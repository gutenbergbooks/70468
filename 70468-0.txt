PREFACE. 

This book was composed when the writer was a Professor of Latin, 
as part of a larger scheme. He has long been convinced that the 
mode of teaching Latin has become less and less effective in 
proportion as it has been made more and more scientific. The 
effort has been general to confine the pupil to the most 
elaborate styles and the most approved classics, and the 
exercise of memory has been superseded by minute accuracy in the 
study of very limited pieces. In the natural mode we have 
enormous endless repetition and much learning of the names of 
things. We begin with short sentences and a very limited number 
of verbs; and we learn with the least possible number of rules. 
If we could talk in Latin, that would be of all best; but as we 
cannot get exercise in talking it for practical needs, no 
teacher can hope to gain adequate readiness and facility: or if 
a few might, yet this could not be counted on in any general 
system. It has long been my conviction that we ought to seek to 
learn a language first, and study its characteristic literature 
afterward. Greek and Latin literature plunge us into numerous 
difficulties all at once, inasmuch as their politics, their 
history, their geography and their religion are all strange to 
the young student. To take difficulties one by one is obvious 
wisdom; and with a view to this I elaborately maintained in an 
article of the Museum (No. iv., Jan., 1862, Edinburgh) that we 
ought to teach by modern Latin. As parts of such a system I have 
executed and published a Latin “Hiawatha,” and Latin Verse 
Translations of many small pieces of English poetry. If I could 
write Latin conversations that would interest learners, I should 
gladly have undertaken this: but when I tried, I could not 
invent matter that seemed interesting enough. This indeed is my 
objection to Erasmus’s “Colloquies,” which also are not easy 
enough in idiom to satisfy me. This “Robinson Crusoe” I thought 
I could make very interesting, and it includes a far greater 
variety of vocabulary than can be obtained from any of our 
received classics of the same length. I hope also the style is 
easy. 

I surely need not apologize for taking only the general idea 
from Defoe. His tale is far too diffuse, too full of moralizing 
and with too little variety. He was very ignorant of the Botany 
and Zoology of the tropics, and when his tale is faithfully 
abridged, its impossibilities become too glaring. The Arabic 
“Robinson Crusoe” published by the Church Missionary Society 
cuts down Defoe’s story unmercifully. 

I am indebted to my former colleague, the late Professor T. 
Hewitt Key, for the translation of Robinson into the name 
Rebilius. He also approved of Ignipulta for a gun, not as 
strictly grammatical, but as good enough to pass with Latins who 
were familiar with the word Catapulta. From him also I adopted 
Cannones, for cannons, and Pistola a pistol. The word Canna, a 
cane (or hollow tube) seems to be the root of Cann̄on, a tube or 
cannon, in Spanish, whence the American can̄on for a tunnel, or 
larger tube. 

After I had executed my own Rebilius (finally completed in 
1861), I learned that a Frenchman, Goffaux, had published a 
“Robinson Crusoe” in Latin and French. On discovering this, I 
stopped the printing which I had begun, and after some delay 
succeeded in getting the book. But on perusing it I found his 
principles of remodelling the tale to be fundamentally the 
opposite of mine, concerning which I need not enlarge. I like 
his Latin, yet do not think his book supersedes mine. But if 
teachers can practically use his with advantage, I shall be well 
satisfied. 

I wish here to renew my protest, that no accuracy of reading 
small portions of Latin will ever be so effective as extensive 
reading; and to make extensive reading possible to the many, the 
style ought to be very easy and the matter attractive. To enable 
us to talk, we ought to have a vocabulary that includes all 
familiar objects,—which the Classics of our schools cannot give 
us. Terence, though somewhat too difficult, would have great 
excellencies for the learner; but the substance of his plays is 
low, and eminently unedifying. 

In the near future, some universal tongue will be sought for by 
the educated. If Latin be still learned in England, France, 
Italy, Germany, Hungary, Spain, this is still, as three 
centuries ago, the best for all Christendom. But perhaps even 
Latin will be beaten out of the schools. 

It may be well to remark, that inasmuch as the grave accent has 
been very widely used in school books as indicative of an 
adverb, I adopt the mark in this sense; and think it no 
objection to say that the Latins never so used it. Neither had 
they our stops. We do not pretend to follow their writing in 
detail. We usefully distinguish the vowels u i from the 
consonants v j; they did not. What should we gain, by writing 
the Iliad as its author wrote it? So too, I think it well 
occasionally to add long or short marks, as ēgēre ĕgēre ēgĕre, 
vēnēre vĕnĕre, lătēre lătĕre lātere, to obviate ambiguity. Nay I 
write fluctûs for gen. sing., fluctūs for plural, but fluctus 
for nomin. sing. When et means both or even, I set an acute 
accent over it, not doubting that it then received some 
emphasis. 

I also borrow from the marks used in Hebrew an under-parenthesis 
for coupling words that are in grammatical union. This mark is 
often very effective in explaining the structure of complicated 
Greek sentences.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.
REBILIĪ CRŪSŌNIS ANNĀLĒS. 



CAPUT PRĪMUM. 


1. Nātus sum ego Eborācī, ex bonā familiā, sed peregrīnā: quippe 
pater meus Germānus fuit ē Brēmā, ubi appellābātur Kreutznaer. 
Cēterum per mercātūram dīves factus, Eborācī cōnsēdit, unde 
recēpit in connūbium mātrem meam. Ex hujus agnātīs praenōmen 
mihi Rebilius, ex patre nōmen Kreutznaer inditum est. Sed vulgus 
hominum, facilī corruptēlā, Crūsōnem mē Rebilium appellābat. 
Tertius eram fīlius familiae. Frāter maximus, tribūnus mīlitum, 
cum Hispānīs proeliō congressus, ad Dunquercam occubuit. Frāter 
proximus, sīcut ego quoque posteā, incertum quōmodo, ēvānuit. Mē 
quidem pater, dīligenter īnstitūtum, jūris lēgumque studiīs 
dēstinābat: sed, fātālī quōdam mōtū, nihil mihi arrīdēbat, nisi 
ut marī oberrārem. 

2. Prīmā in juventā clam patrem ēvāsī nauta. Cursū mox fēlīcī 
cum magistrō nāvis hūmānissimō ad Guineam Āfricae nāvigāvī. 
Alterō in cursū ā Maurīs pīrātīs captus sum, et per quattuor 
ferē annōs dūram servīvī servitūtem. Inde mīrāculō audāciae 
ēlāpsus, in Lūsitānā quādam nāve ad Brazīliam sum dēvectus, ubi 
colōnō cuidam trēs amplius annōs strēnuam operam nāvāvī, 
praefectus servōrum agrestium. Mox per hunc amīcōsque hujus 
adductus sum, ut ad Guineam nāvigārem, hominēs nigrītās 
conquīsītūrus, quōs ipsī inter sē per sua praedia servitūtis 
causā dīviderent. Equidem magnam lucrī partem eram dērīvātūrus. 

3. Sed longē aliter ōrdināvit Deus, nē impūnē caecae cupiditātī 
obsequerer. Nempe ventīs abrepta nāvis Ōceanum trānsīre 
nequībat, sed longē ad Caurum dēvehitur, circā Orinocōnis ōstia, 
ut crēdēbāmus. Altera mox superveniēns procella magnō impetū nōs 
in Occidentem prōpulit, ubi, sī ē marī effugerēmus, per ferōs 
hominēs foret pereundum. 

4. Gravī impendente perīculō, nocte intempestā et saeviente 
adhūc ventō, nauta quī erat in vigiliā “terram adesse” 
exclāmāvit; atque, anteā quam cēterī experrēctī superne 
congregāmur, nāvis in arēnīs haeret. Statim cum strepitū 
tremendō corruunt mālī eōrumque armāmenta. Flūctūs magnā vī 
forōs prōluēbant, neque ipsae nāvis compāgēs diū tolerātūrae 
vidēbantur. 5. Magister scapham dēmittī jubet. Dēmittitur: nec 
facile id quidem. Rēs, quae maximē ad vītam sunt necessāriae, 
raptim ingeruntur; tum nōs ipsī, tredecim virī, in eandem 
dēscendimus. Montōsum lītus inter sublūstrem cālīginem furvum 
appārēbat: eō rēmigāmus, sī quā forte in sinū terrae reductō 
tranquilliōre marī ūtāmur. Jam, violenter undante salō et circum 
nōs sē frangente, rēs nōn nauticae perītiae sed dīvīnae opis 
vidēbātur: quārē inter rēmigandum sē quisque Deō Suprēmō, pius 
impiusve, commendābat, salūte paene dēspērātā. 6. Ventus, ad 
terram prōpellēns, cursum scaphae accelerābat, terram faciēbat 
formīdolōsiōrem; metū autem maris, spē lītoris, ipsī nōsmet 
quasi in certissimum exitium dētrūdēbāmus. Tandem, vadōsiōre 
marī, flūctūs perniciōsius circumfringī et dējectārī scapha. 
Mox, ecce crista undae ingēns, quae nōs persequitur; et vix Deī 
effāmur nōmen, quum cūnctī sumus absorptī. 

7. Quae sequēbantur, longa fortasse ēnārrātū, factū erant 
brevissima. Profundius sēnsī mē verbere flūctūs illīus dēprimī, 
sed, animā fortiter compressā, ad summās aquās ēmersī tandem. 
Alterō in flūctū spūmante implicātus atque violenter 
circumtortus, immēnsum anhēlāns ēluctor; tum conversus, humerōs 
meōs succēdentī oppōnō cristae. Ea mē magnā vī cautem versus 
prōjēcit, aquā exstantem: hanc ego amplexus, adhaereō, dum 
dēcurrit unda; tunc, priusquam novus superveniat flūctus, per 
vada exsiliēns scandō, iterumque amplector cautem; simul, aestū 
paulisper obruor. Ictus ejus mē asperē quassābat, sed extemplō 
āera animamque recēpī, et rūrsus per vada supergredior. Citrā 
saxa undās longē minus ingentēs sēnsī, inter quās poteram 
natāre, aegrē profectō. Mox lītore ipsō prōjectus, uncīs pedibus 
in sabulōnem lapillōsque inculcātīs, prōnus dēcidō, ut nē mē 
flūctus retrahat. Ūnō post temporis mōmentō in terrā firmā astō. 
Conversus, videō praeter lītus cautium seriem, inter albicantēs 
aquās nigrārum; nihil aliud per tenebrās in marī dispiciō, neque 
scapham neque quemquam ē sodālibus. 

8. Tamen haud valdē cālīginōsa erat nox. Ingentēs aliquot nūbēs, 
et plūrimae nūbēculae, sībilante ventō raptābantur: inter hās 
clārissima lūcēbant sīdera ē nigerrimō caelō. Respiciēns ad 
terram, collium dumtaxat cernō līneāmenta ac rūpium. Tum 
vestīmenta raptim dētracta manibus contorqueō, et, quoad possum, 
aquam marīnam exprimō. Eadem rūrsus induor, (quid aliud 
facerem?) et rūpem proximam per algās ēnīsus ascendō; frūstrā: 
nam nē inde quidem in marī quidquam discernī potest. 

9. Attamen arboris fōrma super colle exstat. Hanc sequor, et, ut 
potissimum in cālīgine, arborem illam scandō et rāmōs amplexus 
interfūsusque mē repōnō. Vestīmentōrum in loculīs nihil habuī, 
praeter cultellum, tabācī aliquantum et tubulum fūmārium. Post 
brevem requiem assurgēns, virgam grandiusculam amputō, quā 
prōtegam mē aliquātenus. Aquā marīnā largius īnsorptā, tamen 
neque sitis neque famis aderat mihi levāmen. Sed, locō cibī, 
tabācī folium in ōs meum compōnō, implicātāque rāmīs virgā, 
membra mea ita dispōnō, ut nē dēcidam, sī somnō capiar. 
Vespertīliōnēs, et maximī illī quidem, strīdōribus ac volātū, 
somnum aliquamdiū discutiunt. 

10. Item quoad concitātō opus erat corpore, mēns mea tranquilla 
fuerat ac praesēns: nunc, quandō quiēscit corpus, maximē sē mēns 
agitāre coepit. Imprīmīs grātiās Deō optimō maximō sincērissimās 
profūdī, admīrāns praesertim, sī ego sōlus ex tantō naufragiō 
servor. Mox id ipsum crūdēlissimē mē pungit; etenim hīc 
sōlitārius, madidus, famēlicus, paene nūdus, pejus ēnecor quam 
in marī, nisi vērō ferī hominēs sīve bēstiae mē dēvorābunt. Sānē 
ego id temporis pius nōn eram, minimē religiōsus. Igitur tantā 
in calamitāte magnus mē aestus animī conquassābat, inter grātēs 
querēlāsque, cōnsilium ac dēspērātiōnem. Tandem agitātiōne 
victus profundō somnō conquiēvī, labōris ac maestitiae oblītus. 

11. Māne expergīscor, multum recreātus, sed algēns; nec mīrum. 
Cēterum ibi maris temperiēs hūmānae cutis calōrem aequat: etiam 
nox ipsa tepet: porrō arboris illīus dēnsa folia fuerant mihi 
prō tegumentō, nē calor in apertum aethera effugeret. Sciūrī, 
psittacī, macacī sīve cercopithēcī circum garriēbant 
continenter. Ēvigilāns incipiō dēscendere: ecce autem canis 
noster ad rādīcēs arboris meae, quasi cūstōdiēns. Id mē tenerō 
quōdam ita affēcit gaudiō, ut lacrimae oculīs oborīrentur. Ergō 
nōn sum prōrsus sōlitārius; ūnum saltem retineō amīcum! Hunc 
dēmulceō, plaudō armōs, paene amplector. Mox festīnanter 
dēambulāns, nāvem nostram ex adversō cōnspicor, longiusculē 
ultrā eās cautēs, ubi ipse prōjectus fuī. Sine dubiō aestus 
intumēscēns, ex arēnīs lēvātam, hūc dētrūsit. Jam autem paene 
sōpītō ventō, inānis tantum supererat undārum jactātiō. At ego 
in margine rūpis incēdēns, dēspectō circā lītus: mox, 
interjectīs vix mīlle passibus, scapham nostram discernō in 
arēnā, subter caeruleā quādam rūpe. Adīre eam voluī; sed quasi 
lingua quaedam maris interfūsa impediēbat; et quoniam famē 
urgēbar, in nāvem potius, sī possem, regrediendum cēnsuī. 

12. Dēgressus rūpe, redeō praeter lītus: ibi pilleum nauticum 
videō, summō cum maerōre. Jam aliquantum recesserat aestus, 
atque, ut aestimābam, vix trecentī aquārum passūs ā nāve mē 
distinēbant. Exūtīs pallā bracchiīsque, intrepidē mare ingressus 
sum, inter grallātōriās avēs, quae plūrimae aquā exsurgēbant; et 
facile nāvem natandō assequor. Puppis ejus valdē ēlevāta est, 
dēpressa prōra; ex quā catēnae dēpendentēs aquam tangēbant. Hās 
ego prehēnsās ascendō, et supervādō lōrīcam tabulātōrum. Ō 
trīstem ruīnam, ubi mālī, vēla, fūnēs strāge conturbātissimā 
complicantur. Sed ego ad cellam penuāriam dēcurrō, ibique 
arreptō pāne nauticō (quī bis coctus appellātur) vēscor 
libenter. Mox, ex arcā meā ipsīus extractās, vestēs induor atque 
hōrologium meum resūmō. (Profectō resurgente aestū vesperī, ille 
meus in lītore vestītus natāns asportātus est.) Simul ut aquam 
pōtulentam inveniō, sinūs vestium pāne complēvī, ut quotiēs 
libēret, vēscerer: tum meditābar, quid facerem potissimum. 

13. Illud mē angēbat, quod manifēstē, sī in nāve mānsissēmus, 
omnēs fuissēmus salvī. Super prōrā quidem saepius īnsultantēs 
undae plūrimās rēs corrūperant; sed altera pars, puppim versus, 
altē sublāta, sicca erat atque incolumis. Quippe, ut crēdō, quia 
in arēnā, nōn in cautibus haeserat, carīnae soliditās 
perdūrāvit. Quam plūrimās rēs jam cupiēbam asportāre; sed id 
erat difficile. Scapha major, ut dīxī, in lītore prōjecta erat 
longē. Illa quīndecim virōs facile portābat, et in magnīs 
Āfricae fluviīs ad invehendōs vēnālēs magnō ūsuī erat futūra. 
Alteram comportāverāmus longē minōrem, cymbam potius quam 
scapham dīxerim; quae duōs hominēs cum rēmige posset ad scapham 
dēvehere, sī quā jūxtā rīpās aquae forent breviōrēs. Haec in 
nāve remānsit: dēmittere eam in mare erat in facilī; sed parum 
capiēbat, nec vidēbātur nimiō sub onere aestum lītoris 
tolerātūra. Postquam arcās ac dōlia multō cum suspīrātū 
aliquamdiū aspexī, contemplor mālōs, ac ratem compōnendam 
dēcernō. 

14. Subitō exsultāns, ex fabrī nostrī repositōriō serrā dēreptā, 
mālōs dissecō, ut trabēs longitūdine ferē parēs efficiam. Hās in 
mare prōvolvō, fūnibus quibusdam mālōrum suprā inhibitās. Ligna 
grandiōra cujuscumque generis colligō, ingerō, omnia fūniculīs 
dēligāta. Posteā ipse sēminūdus, cum malleō et cōnfībulārum 
sacculō circum collum suspēnsō, dēgressus equitō super trabe. 
Undātiō maris jam dēminūta est: raptim ego ligna atque trabēs, 
vēlīs fūnibusque cōnfūsās, conjungō, dēstinō, dēpangō; vī meā 
maximā, quantumvīs rudī, ratis fundāmenta jaciēns. Redeō suprā; 
videō quanta sint portanda onera, ratemque nōndum sufficere. Tum 
alia ligna plūrima et tabulās ex omnī parte nāvis conquīrō. Hās 
dissecāre ex suō locō, nimiī labōris erat atque temporis. Sed 
saepta animadvertō lignea, quae ad dīvidenda nigrītārum cubīlia 
comparāveram. Utrumque bīnīs hāmīs ē tergō, bīnīs spīcātīs 
clāvīs ē fundō, erat īnstrūctum; ānulīs laterī nāvis īnfīxīs, 
per quōs hāmī īnserī dēbēbant. Haec saepta plūrimam atque 
optimam mihi sufficiēbant māteriem. Quibus rēbus superadditīs, 
mōlem ratis et soliditātem multum adaugeō; tum fūnibus astringō 
cūncta. Longum id erat et sānē difficile: necnōn sōl mē 
admonēbat hōrārum: hōrologium substiterat. Dēnique postquam, 
graviter īnsultāns ratī, firmitātī ejus cōnfīdō, maximō cum 
dolōre sentiō, vix minimam partem eōrum, quae vellem, posse mē 
asportāre; jam autem dēligendum esse. 15. Ab operā paulisper 
requiēscō; vīnī ārdentis saccharīnī hauriō pōcillum, meditorque 
maestissimē. Ea quae ad vītam maximē sunt necessāria, dēcernō 
sūmere imprīmīs; tum, arma ad vītam dēfendendam. Quattuor 
nautārum arcās commodē vehī posse super ratī meā crēdēbam. 
Totidem exināniō, et, per tollēnōnem[A] sūculīs īnstrūctum, 
dēmittō in ratem: hanc mox scālās versus trahō. Sacculōs impleō 
plūrēs bis coctō pāne, orȳzā, fabīs, mīliāriā atque hordeāceā 
farīnā; et facile in arcās dējiciō. Fabīs atque mīliō praesertim 
erāmus nigrītās cibātūrī, et sānē multum hujus cibī portābāmus, 
sed īnfrā in alveō. Jam trēs cāseōs Batavicōs arripiō, caprīnae 
carnis siccātae massās quīnque, (quā carne vel maximē 
vēscēbāmur,) et frūmentī Eurōpaeī reliquiās quāsdam, quod ad 
gallīnās alendās convēxerāmus. Gallīnae vī procellārum perierant 
omnēs. Cēterum trīticum fuit id, cum hordeō: posteā invēnī 
corruptum esse per sōricēs. 

16. Dein latice ārdentī anquīsītō, vīnī palmāris congiōs ferē 
sex, cum plūrimīs dēlicātiōrum pōtuum lagēnīs, seorsum conclūsī. 
Hae lagēnae partim magistrī fuerant, partim meae ipsīus. 
Lacernam meam et lectī opertōrium corripiō, porrō serram, 
secūrim, malleum clāvōsque: sed haec in cymbā dēstinō portanda. 
Plūrēs fuisse in nāve nitrātī pulveris cadōs majōrēs sciēbam; 
sed ubinam artillātor noster eōs habuisset conditōs, eram 
nescius. Tandem multum anquīsītōs duo invēnī siccōs sānōsque, 
tertium aquā marīnā corruptum. Cistās trēs, hōc pulvere 
complētās, cūrātissimē intrā arcam super ratī ita conclūdō, ut, 
sī flūctus alluat, minimō sit dētrīmentō. Jam dē igne fovendō 
subit cūra. Coquī nostrī recēnseō supellectilem. Inde dēripiō 
foculum cum forcipe, batillō et rutābulō, crāticulam ferream, 
ahēnum, ollamque coculam. Satis oneris jam vidēbar imposuisse. 
17. Cymbam prōtinus per eāsdem sūculās marī committō; id quod 
difficillimum fuisset, nisi requiēssent undae. Hūc impōnō 
ignipultam aucupāriam optimam, pār pistolārum cum balteō, 
mulctram stanneam, igniāria, sīnum ligneum, pōculum ex albō 
plumbō, item corneum; cum vestibus ac fabrīlī supellectile, quam 
nōmināvī. Addō pilulārum plumbeārum sacculum ac gladiōs duo. 
Ūnus hōrum falcātus erat Maurūsiī meī dominī gladius. Sōlem 
videō dēclīnāre; itaque properē fūnem tractōrium ratī adjungō, 
fūniculōs plūrēs in cymbam prōjiciō, jamque dēscendō cum rēmīs, 
ratem ad lītus tractūrus. 

18. Tria mē cōnfirmābant,—mare tranquillum; aestus placidē 
allābēns; aurae quoque, quantum erat, terram versus spīrāns. 
Parvam ancoram in cymbā portābam. Jam rēmigō, atque contus 
animum subit. Redeō, efferō contum: dēmum lītus petō, sed 
dīrēctam viam cautēs prohibēbant. Avēs multae in ratem 
cōnsēdērunt, ut piscārentur commodē. Hās aegrē abigō. Mox sēnsī 
mē praetervehī, ipsō marī clam trahente: inde spērābam posse mē 
in fluviī alicujus ōstium dēportārī, ubi bona mea tūtius 
expōnerem. Id quod ēvenit: nam rūpēs mox subeō, ubi in convallem 
sinus maris intrat. 19. Sed dum rēmīs, quantum possum, medium in 
flūmen cymbam dīrigō, paene alterō naufragiō cōnflīctor, rate 
vadō illīsā. Dēclīvī prōtinus ratī dēlābēbantur ejus onera, nisi 
properē succurrissem. Circumāctā cymbā, ligna aliquot dē rate in 
interstitia ejusdem intrūdō, quasi paxillīs ēnormibus sustinēns 
arcās. Hīc alligātus necessāriō commoror, ānxius sānē animī, 
dōnec aestus īnsurgēns ratem allevāvit. Tum in parvum quendam 
sinum dēvertō, juxtā plānitiem, cui mare dēbēbat superfundī. Eō 
mox dēlātus metuēbam ancoram dējicere, nē tanta mōlēs fūnem 
abrumperet, nisi aquās stāgnāre intellegerem. Tandem recēdēns 
aestus in terrā firmā relinquit et cymbam et ratem. 

20. Onera mea expōnere inūtile erat, nocte appropinquante. In 
arbore aliquā iterum dormīre dēcrēvī; itaque suffertā ignipultā 
armātus, item gladiō serrāque, per ulvās ūberrimās prōcēdō, 
anquīsītūrus idōneum cubīle. Nemus haud longē videō. Ibi dēlectā 
majōre quādam arbore, curvīs trānsversīsque rāmīs, gradūs prō 
scālīs in cortice serrā incīdō; tum scandēns cum serrā amputō 
rāmōrum quidquid sit obfutūrum, et cubandī faciō perīculum. 
Macacōs videō plūrēs in arboribus, sed parvōs mītēsque. 

21. Redeuntī canis occurrit, lepusculum ōre ferēns, quem ante 
pedēs meōs prōjēcit. Intellēxī eum magnam partem dēvorāsse; 
etenim plēnus saturque appārēbat. Sānē ego dōnum ejus nōn 
contempsī, quamvīs laniātum. Accēpī; sed subit cūra, nē sōlō meō 
amīcō prīver, nisi sēdulō pāscam. Magnō erat corpore, multōque 
egēbat cibātū; dē quō incēpī meditārī.—Dulcem aquam juxtā 
cōnspicor, in flūmen marīnum dēcurrentem. Mox frondibus 
foliīsque siccīs igne factō, lepusculī reliquiās super vīvīs 
prūnīs ope gladiī ac serrae torreō, gustātūque ejus quam maximē 
fruor. Prīmam illam in īnsulā sōlitāriā cēnam cum voluptāte 
trīstitiāque mīrē commistā meminī. Jamque cālīgābat. Ego autem 
tabulam quandam reportātam clāvīs dēstināvī ad rāmōs arboris 
meae, ibique lacernā obvolūtus somnō mē dabam. Ignipultam inter 
rāmōs apposueram: canis jacēbat subtus. Pistolīs quoque 
succingor, nē sīmia aliqua major mē incessat. 

22. Et profundē equidem dormīvī, dēfessus labōribus; tamen ante 
lūcem sum experrēctus: (etenim illā in regiōne aestātis ipsīus 
nox proximē ante dīlūculum tenebrās obtendit:) atque ego 
meditāns cōnsilia mea compōnō. Ut prīmum dīlūcēscit, dēscendō. 
Ligna aliquot exacuō secūrī; tum prō sublicīs in arēnam ita 
adigō, ut ratem, quamvīs crēscentibus aquīs, inhibeant. Nitrātī 
pulveris cistās lacernā prōtegō, sī forte pluat. Serram,—
malleum,—clāvōs,—tabulās duās, rōbustam tenuemque,—argillam 
mollem, cum vetere fūne prō stuppā,—in cymbam collocō. Aquam 
mulctrā haustam sūmō mēcum, item pōculum ac pānem. Lepusculī, 
quod restat, cum cane dīvidō, ipsōque in cymbam adsūmptō flūmen 
ingredior, scapham nostram invīsūrus. 

23. Plēnō maris aestū, tardius dēscendō flūmen; mox intrā cautēs 
lītus lēgō, nē quid undārum mē incommodet. Magis magisque 
admīror avium abundantiam, quā marīnārum, quā silvestrium. Inter 
cautēs ac lītus grallātōriae abundābant. Ad scapham tandem 
pertingō; perfrāctam inveniō, velut animō praecēperam; 
crēdideram posse mē dētrīmenta ejus resarcīre. Sed vīgintī 
passūs ā marī jacēbat, procellā aestūque illīus noctis longē 
ēvecta; neque summā meā vī potuit movērī. Porrō, rēmōs idōneōs 
neque habēbam, neque, sī habērem, adhibēre possem, onustā certē 
scaphā. Aeger animī hanc relinquō, rēmigōque nāvem versus. 
Cōgitāns autem statuō mālum vēlumque scaphae anquīrere, sī forte 
posteā hōrum ūsus vēnerit. 

24. Ad scālās nāvis accēdō. Hās natāns nōn potueram manū 
attingere: etenim puppis nimium erat ēlāta. Sed astāns in cymbā, 
facile eās apprehendō. Cane prīmum superpositō, alligātāque 
cymbā, ipse ascendī; mox dēsideō inops cōnsiliī. Ōllam offendō 
frūctuum condītōrum: cum pāne vēscor, dum cōgitō. Videō alteram 
ratem nōn posse mē cōnstruere; spatium diēī nōn sufficere, sī 
trabēs ipsā ex nāve sint dissecandae; lōrīcam tabulātōrum 
discindere, labōriōsum fore, nec valdē ūtile. 25. Maurōrum 
memineram ratēs utribus suffultās. Utrēs nōn habēbam. Arcās 
aquae impenetrābilēs volēbam prō utribus adhibēre; sciēbam autem 
nostrās solidō esse rōbore et astrīctā fabricā. Ūnaquaeque hārum 
ligneō pessulō rudīque serā obdēbātur; cūncta comparī erant 
modulō. Diē superiōre, dissectō serrā pessulō, facile aperueram 
quattuor illās; īdem nunc faciō in cēterīs, atque exinānītārum 
explōrō commissūrās. Artissimae vidēbantur; id gaudeō: sed 
fūnibus properē in mare dēmīsī quattuor hārum, ut commissūrae 
aquā intumēscerent; meam ipsīus, quae optimē fabrēfacta est, 
pice ac stuppā circā operculum incēpī oblinere, perīculum 
faciēns, num aquam exclūdere possem. Postquam operuī, cuneōs 
tenuēs ligneōs juxtā pessulum īnferciēbam, quō astrīctissimē 
conclūderem. Hanc in mare dēmīsī, fundō sūrsum sustentātam; 
atque ibi religātam relīquī, ut operam meam aqua explōrāret. 

26. Jam videō diem prōcēdere, metusque subitō mē incessit, nē 
quis thēsaurōs meōs ē rate compīlāret, nēve bēstia corrumperet 
cibum. Īnsula foret an continēns terra, culta an inculta, 
ferōcibus bēstiīs īnfēsta necne,—nōndum sciēbam. Ratis autem 
dīlēctissima oculīs sōlīque exposita manet, dum ego novās hīc 
rēs conquīrō! Crēdēbam nōn posse mē illō ipsō diē novae ratis 
onus asportāre; satius esse, redīre quam citissimē. Illud 
succurrit: “Heri, quae ad vītam maximē erant necessāria, āvēxī; 
hodiē, quae pondere levissima sunt, nūndinātiōne pretiōsissima, 
āveham in cymbā; ut sī forte nāvis aliqua mē servābit, nē 
prōrsus sim pecūniae inops.” Duo gladiōs pulchrōs ē caeruleō 
chalybe inveniō; hōs avidē sūmō. In sēcrētō magistrī scrīniō 
aureōs nummōs Hispānōrum (doblounōs vocant) certō sciēbam 
continērī; quōs ille comportābat, nē, ventōrum vī aliquō 
dēvectus, pecūniā ad reficiendam nāvem egēret. Dolābrā prōtinus 
forēs scrīniī perfringō: inveniō autem nōn aurī sōlum crumēnās, 
sed īnstrūmentum astrologicum, pretiōsum illud quidem, ac duo 
optima hōrologia; item furcillam mēnsālem et cochlear, utrumque 
ex argentō; mox duās acūs magnēticās, utramque suā in capsulā: 
tertiam vīderam ipsum juxtā gubernāculum, propter ūsum 
gubernandī. In mēnsulā offendō supellectilem geōgraphicam ac 
scrīptōriam, cum librīs quattuor. Cūncta arripiō, et quasi vōtum 
Deō concipiō, numquam, quantum in mē est, cognātōs magistrī 
optimī quidquam lātūrōs damnī, sī forte in hominum gregem 
restituar. 

27. Dum meōs ipsīus perscrūtor loculōs, unde argentum, arculās 
optimās clāvēsque avēbam, illud “sī forte” animum aurēsque meās 
pertentat. Immō tōtum hunc diem quasi rhythmus quīdam “sī forte” 
tinnit in auribus, dum rēmigō, dum incēdō. Jam rēs 
pretiōsissimās in arculīs conclūseram, quum scaphae meminī 
armāmenta. Haec facile reperiō. Mālum ejus ad terram attrahendum 
dēcernō, pōne cymbam alligātum. Quamvīs properāns, temperāre 
mihi nequīvī, quīn lārdī asportārem succīdiam, cum bulbōrum 
majōrum marsūpiō ac capide duōbusque cultrīs. Dein, quidquid 
vidēbam corbium, fiscōrum, riscōrum, quod natāre poterat, 
restibus cōnstringō, et pōne trahō, in cymbā portāns mē ipsum ac 
canem cum novīs thēsaurīs. Ecce autem, dum in eō sum, ut nāvem 
relinquam, duae fēlēs cymbae īnsiliunt, quās quidem neque ego 
neque canis aspernātur. 

28. In rēmigandō, vereor nē agmen meum, pōne tractum, vadō 
flūminis illīdātur; in lītus potius prōjicere volō. Dein locum 
putō exquīrendum, ubi ratis mea posterō diē tūtissimē appellat: 
nam sī arcae in fundō ratis aliquō afflīgerentur, maximum fore 
perīculum nē cūnctae rēs disperīrent. Dīxī linguā quādam maris 
prīmō illō māne mē ā scaphā intersaeptum. Hanc videō ad dextram 
cautium, eōque dīrigō cursum. Corbēs, mālum scaphae, cētera, 
facile in lītus sūrsum trahō; dein sinum illum maris properō 
intrāre. 

29. Circā quīngentōs passūs penetrābat terram, rūpe praecipitī 
undique circumclūsus. Ōstium angustius erat, quia aspera saxa 
utrimque exsurgēbant postium īnstar. Lītus intimum ē mollissimā 
ac plānissimā erat arēnā; id quod facile perspexī, quia nōndum 
altius pertinuerat aestus. Ultrā arēnam videō algās cactōsque. 
Hūc certum est ratem illam crās dēdūcere. Quae quum summā 
celeritāte lūstrāssem, contentīs bracchiīs domum rēmigō: nempe 
domum īre, erat, ad opēs meās. Intrā cautēs mare invēnī tunc 
quidem sānē tranquillum. 

30. Ad coquendum prōtinus accingor, praesertim (sī crēdere 
possīs) propter canem; immō, propter fēlēs item; namque ad 
quidvīs, quod posset mē amāre, mīrē allectābar. Quattuor intrā 
lapidēs ignem accendō. Trēs stīpitēs, īnfrā arēnae īnfīxōs, 
suprā fūne colligō; inde suā catēnā suspendō ahēnum coculum. 
Aquam in capide apportātam īnfundō; addō fabās, farīnam 
hordeāceam, lārdī segmen cum bulbō. Māteriā ignī largius 
injectā, ignipultam arripiō pārōque collem ascendere quī haud 
longē aberat. Canem mēcum adsūmō, fēlēs crēdō propter fervōrem 
ignis nihil nocitūrās cibō. 31. Mīlle quīngentōs passūs ad 
summum aestimābam iter illud; sed quia propter rīvulum quendam 
atque ūvidum solum circuīvī, longius erat aliquantō. Dēmum 
ēnīsus per praecipitia, mare undique circumfūsum cōnspicor, 
aliam nūllā ex regiōne terram, praeter scopulōs aliquot duāsque 
pusillās īnsulās novem ferē mīllia occīdentem versus. Ūnus in 
postīcō mōns mare exsuperābat; sed tamen eram in īnsulā. Hoc mē 
magnopere angēbat. 

32. Magnā ex parte sterilior vidēbātur īnsula, saxōsīs collibus 
abundāns, nōn sine arboribus; quae quidem in cavīs locīs 
dēnsābantur. Nisi numerārem fēlem quandam feram, carnivorās nōn 
offenderam bēstiās; sed praeter macacōs ac sciūrōs in convalle, 
leporēs et exiguōs porcillōs vīderam; avēs autem nōtās 
ignōtāsque ubīque quam plūrimās. Ālitem majōrem, arborī 
īnsidentem, glandibus olōrīnīs trānsverberō rediēns. Plūma ejus 
rōstrumque accipitris erat, unguēs modicae, carō piscibus 
foetida. Tum vērō mēmet increpābam quod jaculandī suppetiās 
perderem. Ālitēs autem rapācēs, quamquam plūrimōs, nōn magnōs 
illōs vīderam. Porrō ferās hujus īnsulae cōram homine plērāsque 
intrepidās esse repperī. Ā collis jugō ingentēs prōspiciō 
arborēs, quās aestus in flūmine resurgēns dēbeat alluere. Hae 
suprā ratem erant, neque procul ab arbore in quā proximā nocte 
dormīveram. Subter hās statuō ratem attrahere, succēdente aestū. 
Sed properē reversus, ignem exstīnctum inveniō, cibum nōn male 
coctum. Fēlēs, valdē famēlicae, magnā vōce querēbantur. Hās et 
canem largiter pāscō; et mēcum statuō, plūrēs etiam mē fabās, sī 
possim, nāve extractūrum. 

33. At ferae vīsiō fēlis mē commōverat aliquantum. Verēbar nē 
majōrēs ejusmodī bēstiae hīc dēgerent, ut pardus, ut panthēra, 
quae arborēs facile ēscendunt. Circumvallāre mē certus sum. 
Ūtēnsilibus arreptīs fabrīlibus cum māteriā ac fūne, petō 
arborem meam; ubi, incīsūrīs secūrī impressīs, pālōs īnfīgō, 
brevēs tabulās suprā dēstinō, tum quattuor dēsuper pālīs contrā 
ictūs īnfernōs corrōborō. Quippe intellēxī fēlem quamcumque ab 
ipsā stirpe arboris tamquam incurrere sūrsum; et sī quid 
praeruptē ēmineat, arcērī. Restim autem quasi in ānulōs duōs 
sīve āmenta complicō, quem rāmīs alligātum, ipse possim 
prehendere ascendēns. Tālī tum podiō arborem, ut poteram, 
praetexuī: posteā cōnfirmāvī, plēniōre adjūtus supellectile. 34. 
Jam videō noctem aestumque approperāre. Sublicīs ēvulsīs, pōne 
cymbam trahō ratem, appōnōque sub arbore ingentī incolumem; ubi 
latēre posse crēdēns, sublicīs iterum dēpangō. Deonerātā cymbā, 
compōnō rēs omnēs accūrātē. Tum, crāstinīs cōnsiliīs aestuāns, 
tamen somnō celeriter corripior, ālātīs blattīs atque 
vespertīliōnibus contemptīs. 

35. Ēvigilō ante dīlūculum. Dēproperō ad cymbam dētrūdōque in 
fluvium; canis quasi suō jūre īnsilit. Subter stēllīs rēmigō, 
adversō aestū. In nāvem invādō, etiam ante sōlem ortum; sed 
dīlūcēscēbat. Īnspiciō arcam meam; optimē aquam exclūserat. 
Cēterās item ē marī subtractās stuppā ac pice pariter ac meam 
ipsīus conclūdō. Omnia fūnibus contentissimīs astringō. Mox 
quattuor sufficere videntur; immō sīc tūtius fore ad prīmum 
experīmentum. Hīs in mare dēlātīs, et firmissimē cōnstrictīs 
superpōnō dōlium pulveris nitrātī, alterum pānis, mox tōtum 
fabrī repositōrium. Adjungō sēriam oleī, ōllam picis, arma 
missilia aliquot, aliās rēs minōrēs. Vēla quotquot invēnī, quae 
supervacānea portābāmus, cum scaphae vēlō, collocāvī suprā; 
superque hīs rūrsus carbasum quendam pice liquidā oblitum. 
Tantum onus facillimē vidēbantur arcae tolerāre. 

36. Postquam restibus omnia cōnsolidāvī, paulō ante merīdiem, 
strēnuō nīsū ratem ad lītus trahō, paene īnfimō in aestūs 
recessū. Sed inter postēs saxeōs in sinum illum prōcēdō, neque 
in flūmen adversum volō mē committere. Mare intrā mox 
quiētissimum inveniō, et quasi in stāgnō religō ratem. Maximē 
gāvīsus, prōjiciō mē sub rūpe et paulisper sub umbrā requiēscō: 
dein cibō recreātus, ad operam redeō. 37. Quidquid erat in rate, 
in algōsum siccae arēnae acervum expōnō; sed labōriōsē, propter 
humilēs aquās. Videō mare adhūc tranquillum; crās posse coorīrī 
procellās. Spēs et cupiditās, quamvīs lassō, dedit vīrēs. Cum 
carbasō illō (sī forte sit ūsuī) atque cūnctīs fūnibus retrahō 
ratem ad nāvem. Quīntam illam properē adjungō arcam, et aliquot 
rēs ponderōsās impōnō; inter quās hīc nōmināre libet molam 
ferrāmentīs acuendīs, glandium majōrum cadulōs duo: in cymbā 
autem meās vestēs, et pulveris nitrātī aliquantum. Cūncta 
dēportō intrā postēs marīnōs incolumia paulō ante tenebrās. 
Valdē dēfessus inde redībam: sed aestus cymbam subvēxit sine meā 
vī. Vix poteram cēnāre; igitur pāstō cane fēlibusque, somnō mē 
commīsī. 



CAPUT (II.) SECUNDUM. 


38. Trium diērum rēs gestās nārrāvī singillātim. Īmō in corde 
meō īnscrīptae sunt, quasi hesternae essent. In iīs quae 
sequuntur, saepius accidet, ut rem probē nōverim, diem meminerim 
parum; nec lēctōrī jūcundum foret, ut rēs, sī possem, diāriī 
mōre ēnārrārem. Dehinc, quae ex nāve īnsuper āvēxī, summātim 
potius memorābō. 39. Quārtō māne dormīvī post lūcem. Jejūnus, 
vēscor avidē: etenim in ahēnō cibus aliquot diērum mihi meīsque 
restābat. Sed quasi nervīs succīsīs, languēbat animus 
fastīdiēbatque suōs successūs. “Cūr labōrō?” inquiēbam “cūr-ve 
juvat mē vīvere, sōlitārium, moribundum? Quid prōsunt nāvis 
spolia, nisi ut aliquot diēs vītam extraham?” Tum addidī clārā 
vōce: Nisi forte! Nisi forte! Mox intellegō ventum ā marī flāre, 
aestum violentius īnsurgere, in ōstiō perīculōsum forsitan 
cymbae fore. Cymbulam autem illam majōris quam cūncta quae in 
nāve restābant aestimābam. 40. Tum sī ad nāvem ratem ē portū meō 
trāxissem—etenim illum maris sinum postibus mūnītum jam Portum 
Meum appellābam—quis spondēret, quīn naufragium ipsō in flūmine 
paterer rediēns? Nūbēs porrō volitāre animadvertī; imber nē 
caderet, melius tegī, quae exposita relīqueram in portū. Etenim 
cava plūra illā in rūpe cognōveram. Illūc igitur pedibus 
cōnfestim īre dēcernō. 41. Rūpēs ad laevam prīmō rubra erat, 
nisi ubi algā obtegerētur; ipsō in portū alba; ulterius praeceps 
ac caerula: omnis autem ē saxō (ut crēdidī) calcāriō. Portus 
cavīs locīs, immō cavernīs abundābat, quārum in aliquam possem 
sine magnō labōre eās rēs recondere, quās pluvia corrumperet 
potissimum. Per algās cactōsque ēnīsus, hūc reposuī lectum 
vestēsque omnēs, item pānem, ignipultās ac nitrātum pulverem, 
carbasō illō piceātō contēcta. Rēs fabrīlēs et cētera graviōra 
vēlīs obtēxī. 

42. Jam corporis illuviēs mē vexat; nam per trēs labōriōsissimōs 
diēs ac duās noctēs iīsdem in vestīmentīs illōtus mānseram. 
Discingor natātūrus. Plēnō ferē aestū quasi lacus maris 
clārissimus cōram redundābat. Cadēbat pluvia tenuis, sed inter 
nūbēs radiābat jubar; mox appārēbat arcus caelestis. Mīrē ille 
vīsus stringit mulcetque animum meum. 43. Atquī canis in aquam 
mē īnsequitur et mēcum vult lūdere. Nostrātium canum ille 
fortasse Grāiō Hībernōrum canī simillimus erat, Molossō 
domesticō gracilior et vēlōcior, glabrō item corpore, ut 
calōribus nātō. Probē natābat, sed digitātus erat, nōn palmipēs (
quod appellant); id est, digitīs nōn erat pellītīs; atque ego 
vēlōcitāte natandī facile eum superābam. Itaque hunc dum ēlūdō, 
mē recreō. Ut ex aquā ēgressus sum, is crūra pedēsque meōs tam 
amanter lambit, atque tam gestit mē recuperāsse, ut nequīverim 
mē continēre. In effūsum flētum solvor, velut ōlim in pueritiā, 
sentiōque cor exonerārī. Vestēs mūtāvī: immundās in aquā marīnā 
sub majōribus lapillīs dēmergō: tum ēgredior, īnsulam 
explōrātūrus. 44. Scandō ē portū per ardua. Inde videō illum 
collem, quō anteā ēnīsus sum, hōc ā latere ascēnsū facillimum. 
Culmen rūpium plānitiēs erat sīve campus calcārius, dēlicātīs 
vestītus herbīs. Hae recentī pluviā ita erant recreātae, ut nova 
veteribus admixta folia flōrum praetulerint speciem, ubi rubor 
vel purpura cum novō virōre contendēbant. Leporēs sīve cunīculī 
suīs ē latibulīs ēgredientēs audentius mē aspexēre, quōs nē 
īnsequerētur, aegrē repressī canem. 

45. Mox in scopulōsa locō ēvādō, et caprōs discernō ferōs 
procul; antilopās potius dīxerim. Pōne saxa īnserpō, quamquam 
minimē fugācēs erant. Glandibus olōrīnīs tubum sufferciō; dein 
igne ēmissō occīdō capram vulnerōque haedum jūxtā. Canis 
intercurrēns haedum prehēnsā pelle attinet, dum assequor. Crūre 
vulnerātam posteriōre inveniō; poterat tamen incēdere. Mātrem 
voluī reportāre ad flūmen vallemque meam; sed fateor, adhūc eram 
tam dēlicātus, ut nōluerim recentem vestītum sanguine 
commaculāre. Sūdāriō ē sinū vestis extractō, argillāque ūdā in 
vulnus compressā, cōnstrīnxī firmiter; tum grāmine sanguinem 
omnem abstersī. 46. Voluī eam in cervīcibus portāre; sed quandō 
cōnor, id vērō meās vīrēs exsuperat. Super glāreōsam humum 
aegerrimē cornibus eam trahō, in grāmine facilius. Haedī 
cornibus fūniculō circumdatō, hanc dūcō mēcum simul; id quod, 
dum ignipultam portō, paene nimium erat; igitur saepius cōnsēdī. 
Via autem et dēclīvis erat, nec longa, circā alterum jugī latus; 
itaque tandem pervēnī. 47. Prōtinus in ūdō linteō crūs haedī 
astringō; et, nē longus sim, tantā cūrā foveō pāscōque (nam 
grandiuscula erat) ut mānsuētissima ēvāserit. In arēnā, juxtā 
ratem prīmam, sub dēnsīs umbrīs, pēlvem excavō; in quam, aquā 
sēmisalsā replētam, recondō capram, ut ōtiōsius carnī coquendae 
dem operam. Canem appropinquāre vetuī; pāscō autem līberāliter 
et hunc et fēlēs: avēs tamen metuō, nē carnis sint cupidae. 

48. Dum strēnuē mē exercēbam, vix sentiēbam miseriās meās: sed 
simul ac lassitūdō abrumperet operam, nisi somnō corriperer, 
mēns coepit agitārī: id quod saepius mihi ēvēnit. Meās egomet 
cōgitātiōnēs nequībam tolerāre, et variīs quasi ventīs hūc illūc 
ferēbar. In dēspērātissimā conditiōne mē vidēbam, extrā nāvium 
Eurōpaeārum cursum. Frāctō animō, lūgēns, interdum lacrimāns, 
diffīsus Deō, dēcrēta ejus conquerēns; rūrsus ipse mēmet 
objūrgābam, sōlābar, hortābar, cōnfirmābam, maximē gāvīsus quod 
tot rēs ē nāve congessissem. 49. Itaque per id tempus, quoniam 
apud nēminem potuī vicem miserārī meam, aperuī capsam 
scrīptōriam, ex quā chartam, calamōs, ātrāmentum, prōtulī, 
incipiōque angōrēs meōs argūmentandō effundere, quasi per 
sermōnem. Mox tālem altercātiōnem in tabulās (ut ita dīcam) 
acceptī impēnsīque referō, quās lēctōris oculīs nunc subjicere 
libet. 

MALA MEA.                    LEVĀMENTA MALŌRUM.
      
1. In īnsulā sōlitāriā sum   1. At nōn es dēmersus, sīcut
   prōjectus.                   cēterī.
   
2. Ego ūnus ē sodālibus      2. At tibi ūnī restat spēs
   ēnecor aegrimōniā.           aliqua effugiī.
      
3. Exsulō ē societāte        3. At nōn servīs hominibus 
   hominum.                     scelestīs.
      
4. Vī bēstiārum sum plānē    4. At nōn in belluōsam Āfricam 
   obnoxius.                    prōjectus.
      
5. Labōriōsissimē vīctum     5. At magnam tū habēs ex nāve opem.
   quotīdiānum quaerō.
      
6. Serviō hīc servitūtem     6. At aliōs tū in servitūtem nōn 
   perpetuam.                   redigis.
      
7. Nisi prius sōlitāriē      7. At nōn tua magis quam parentum
   moriar, ad sōlitāriam        senectūs erit sōlitāria.
   senectūtem reservor.
   
50. Profectō ultima illa nimis mē pupugēre. Quae prō levāmentīs 
scrīpsī, vulnus animī recrūdēscere fēcērunt. “Peccāvī,” inquam: 
“meritam poenam tolerābō virīliter: fortasse ipsa poena aliquid 
tandem bonī afferet.” Tum cito sēdāta est omnis mea perturbātiō. 
Ego autem haec atque tālia reputāns, admīror, quanta sit vīs vel 
incertae obscūraeque religiōnis, sī modo rēctā intendātur viā. 
Illud fortasse et sī forte plūris est, quam quis putāverit; quia 
saepius indicium est animī per tenebrās, lūcem versus, 
ēnītentis. Id autem ipsum est virtūs: nam sapientissimus quisque 
nostrum in suā tamen versātur cālīgine, semperque ēluctātur 
plēniōrem versus lūcem. Itaque iterum ēvāsī strēnuus. 51. Tum 
canī fēlibusque haedum conciliāre studeō. Omnēs paxillīs dēpangō 
vīcīnīs; ūnīcuique suum largior cibātum; ūnumquemque suā vice 
dēmulceō. Ex cōnsuētūdine spērō familiāritātem, ex meā cāritāte 
cāritātem mūtuam. Posteā ad portum cane comitante reversus, 
aliās explōrō cavernās, plūrēsque rēs melius ōrdinō. 52. 
Tredecim diēs in terrā dēgēbam, necdum nāvis ēvānuerat. Illam 
ūndeciēs (crēdō) ascendī. Quantumvīs coacervāveram, plūs tamen 
concupīscēbam; et dum nāvis cōnsistēbat, inter eam portumque 
meum ācerrimum sustentō ratis commercium. Rēs aliquot, quās 
āvēxī, libet hīc memorāre: Incūdem artillātōris, quam aegerrimē 
āmōlītus sum; virgās vectēsque ferreōs; pēnsilem lectum cum 
lōdīcibus; supparum antīcum ē subsidiāriīs: lacernās plūrēs: 
piscātōriam supellectilem novam atque amplam. Porrō ē rē 
jaculātōriā magnōs forcipēs follēsque, malleum rōbustissimum, 
pēlvēs ferreās ad plumbum liquefaciendum, batillum grande. Tum 
omnēs ignipultās, bonās malās, asportō; item alterum pār 
pistolārum. Dēmum fabrīlem mēnsam, retināculō cochleātō 
īnstrūctam, multō cum labōre per tollēnōnem dēmittō, laetusque 
comperiō hanc per sē natāre. Inter minōrēs rēs memorō lībram cum 
lancibus ahēneīs, sīve trutinam oportet appellāre, quam in 
scrīniō magistrī offendī. Ille propter medicās, crēdō, ūsūs 
habēbat; nam magister nautīs prō medicō erat. Ego hanc, velut 
pecūniās, idcircō asservāvī, sīquandō prō nummīs valēret. 
Ingentem plumbī convolūtī lāminam, quae nimia posset esse, 
secūrī malleōque discissam particulātim asportāvī; etiam magnum 
pilulārum plumbeārum vim, plūrēs rudentēs, fūnēs, ferreōs hāmōs, 
clāvōs, pessulōs, cōnfībulās, ānulōs. Cannōnās suā ex sēde nōn 
eram dēturbātūrus. Posteā magnum trīticī dōlium laetus inveniō, 
sēriam optimī adōris, saccharī cadum majōrem, vīnī ārdentis 
amphorās trēs; porrō cultrōs furcillāsque mēnsālēs, grandem 
forficem, trēs novāculās, quattuor nautārum gladiōs sīve sīcās.

53. Nē forte mīrētur lēctor, quārē tantam bellicī terrōris vim 
in mercātōriā nāve vēxerīmus, nātūram illīus commerciī cūrātius 
dēmōnstrābō. Hominēs barbarōs ē Guineā erāmus in servitūtem 
reportātūrī; quem ad ūsum et ipsa nāvis et omnis ejus dispositiō 
cēterīs erat valdē dīversa. Grandiuscula erat nāvis, nāvālēs 
sociī sexdecim. Cannōnās habēbat quīnque,—ūnam ā tergō,—nē forte 
aut cum praedōnibus aut cum nigrītīs foret cōnflīgendum; nēve, 
propter subitum aliquod in Eurōpā bellum, Lūsitāniā implicātā, 
nōs tamquam Lūsitānī lacesserēmur. Ignipultae quoque inerant 
plūrēs, pars vēnandō, alia pars pugnae apta. Simul pulveris 
nitrātī plumbīque rotundātī vim magnam vehēbāmus, atque adeō 
hominem ūnum tōtī reī jaculātōriae praefectum: Artillātor 
appellābātur. Hārum rērum impēnsā valdē minuitur negōtiātōribus 
lucrum, nisi quod hōc in commerciō merx quae exportātur 
vīlissima est; quae reportātur, pretiōsissima. 

54. Aliquot fabās prīmā in rate asportāvī. Quamquam sciēbam 
magnam hujus cibī vim nāvī fuisse impositam, sed īnfrā in alveō, 
crēdidī marīnā aquā corruptam esse. Nihilōminus dēscendō. Puppim 
versus omnia sicca erant; in īnferiōre parte aqua stāgnābat. Sed 
nōn mē illud repellit. Īnfrā nūdus, per aquam incēdō, quae genū 
attingēbat, scrūtorque mercēs palpandō: tandem saccōs inveniō 
fabīs plēnōs. Ūnum hōrum placēbat āvehere, sed quandō cōnor, 
nequeō ad tabulāta extollere. Rē dēlīberātā, nōn operae pretium 
vidētur dē cibō madidō labōrem pendere; nam asservārī posse quis 
spoponderit? 55. Mox rēs dūrās acūtāsque sub pedibus sentiō; 
ipsa erant ferrāmenta, quae inter mercēs nostrās imperāveram. 
Pālae, plānē nostrātium īnstar, profectō nōn inerant; tantum 
ligōnēs, furcillātaeque marrae, praeter sarcula ac dolābrās. 
Deinde in secūrēs incidō. Tālēs rēs sub aquā dījūdicāre, paulum 
difficile erat. Num operae esset pretium auferre,—dubitābam. 
Tandem aliquot cujusque generis assūmō, praesertim capita 
secūrium ac ligōnum. 56. Posteā fēlīcior eram. Nam in conclāvī 
quōdam, quod coquī nostrī erat proprium, quīnque offendī corbēs, 
fabārum plēnās, apprīmē siccārum. Hās cūrātius repōnō āvehendās, 
et aliam post aliam cūnctās dēmum ad terram dēportō salvās. 57. 
Porrō dum mēnsam fabrīlem āmovēbam, quae suprā erat, nōn in 
alveō, pōne in angulō fascēs quōsdam mercium retēxī. Hōs aperiō. 
Intus erant versicolōrēs vestēs, quās propter Āfrōrum commercium 
imperāveram. Avidē corripiō, sed nesciēbam quārē. Posteā 
numerāvī, invēnīque sexāgintā. Cēterae, ut opīnor, fuerant in 
alveō. 

58. Duodecimō māne, ut rēmigō ex portū ratem pōne trahēns, 
flūctus asperior aliquantum aquae in cymbam immīsit. Exhaurīre 
simul atque rēmigāre nōn poteram: sī rēmōs inhibērem, verēbar nē 
dēflexa cursū cymba latus undīs objiceret. In portum, ut tūtius, 
statim redeō: ibi rōborandam suscipiō cymbam. Altiōrem faciō 
prōram, additīs tabulīs, quae, ferreīs virgīs firmātae, 
aliquantum asperginis possint rejicere. Nōn longī labōris erat 
illud; sed nimius ventus mē terrēbat, igitur reliquum diem 
scaphae addīxī. 59. Illud cōnsīderāveram. Naufragium recente 
lūnā passī erāmus ipsīs in Kalendīs Septembribus. Ad plēnilūnium 
iterum intumēscente Ōceanō posse crēdēbam sublevārī scapham; 
grande mōmentum, servārētur-ne an prōrsus cōnfringerētur. Ex 
arcīs meīs ūnam dēligō, aquae (sīquā alia) impenetrābilem. 
Quidquid in scaphā īnfirmum vidētur, summā meā arte reficiō, seu 
stuppā ac pice, seu argillā vitreāriā opus sit. Simul ac aestus 
recesserat, ancoram quam longissimē per arēnās mare versus 
trahō, suō ancorālī artius scaphae colligātam. Dentem ancorae 
firmiter dēfīgō, quoad possum. Ipsō in ancorālī, circā septem 
pedēs ab ancorā, fūnem brevem nōdō astrictissimō implicō; mox 
hūc dēportātam arcam eōdem fūne connectō. 60. Illud ēvenit, quod 
spērāveram. Arca, aestū īnsurgente sublevāta, simul ut ad 
scapham aqua pertingēbat, (nam ego cum spē metūque cūncta 
notābam) incēpit scapham attrahere. Tum prō cūpā[B] natante arca 
mihi erat. Cōnfestim dēcurrō ad cymbam. Per aestum rēmigō, ubi 
propter altitūdinem aquae flūctus nōn sē frangēbat; et ut prīmum 
scapham assequor, eam remulcō inhibēns, solvō ancorāle; nam 
ancoram extrahere, nimiī id fuisset temporis. Mox, ovāns et 
praegestiēns, scapham in portum dēdūcō incolumem. Haec in 
duodecimō erant diē. 61. Māne īnsequente, quum speculor, sentiō 
marī male crēdī: tamen quāsdam etiam rēs voluī ēripere, quamquam 
ratī nōn cōnfīdēbam. Scālās nāvis ac tollēnōnem ad ultimum 
relīqueram. Optimās habēbat forēs diaeta[C] prīncipālis: hās 
concupīvī, quia bonā erant fabricā. Cardinēs facile āvellō: 
forēs reste firmiter colligō. Dein sūculās[D] cum trochleīs[E] 
assūmpsī; ipsīus porrō tollēnōnis ferrāmenta omnia: sed scapum 
rōstrumque ejus, quae lignea erant, trahenda per aquās 
dēstināvī, cum scālīs et foribus. Ferreum onus, ūnō homine nōn 
gravius, in cymbā dēcernō asportāre. 

62. Impigrē rediī, sed aestus in hōrās magis tumēscēbat. Tunc 
quum maximē intrābam portūs ōstium, agmen pōne tractum adeō 
disjectābat cymbam, ut ego perterritus fūnēs necessāriō 
absolverim, nē dēmergerer. Incolumis egomet postēs illōs 
praetereō, laetus quod nīl mihi cymbaeque accidisset, praeter 
asperginem profūsam. 63. Ventus etiam atque etiam incrūdēscēbat: 
post trēs hōrās violenta flābat procella, quae tōtam per noctem 
furēbat. Māne, ut prōspexī, ēvānuerat nāvis. 



CAPUT (III.) TERTIUM. 


64. Equidem ut vacuum aspectābam mare, neque lacrimātus sum 
neque gemuī, nē agitābar quidem animō. Sed tenerum quendam 
sentiēbam affectum, tamquam sī fessā aetāte parēns, cujus magnīs 
fruimur beneficiīs, lēgitimē ac necessāriō dēcessisset. Immō nōn 
tam nāvis quam egomet vidēbar obiisse mortem. Ab hominibus 
abscindor, novō sum in orbe rērum, astō tamquam in aeternitātis 
sōlitūdine. Ignōtus mē circumambit Deus, cujus sentiō tum 
misericordiam tum sevēritātem, mē ipsum culpāns sed nōn amārē, 
nec sine modō. Nōn in genua prōcumbō; nōn precēs, nōn vōta 
concipiō; grātēs nōn effundō, nec paenitentiam; tamen caeca 
quaedam, ut opīnor, mē penetrābat venerātiō. Certē eram et 
tranquillissimus, et quasi religiōsē dēfīxus. 65. Ex hōc statū 
mē expergēfacit canis, amanter blandiēns. “Āh! quam vellem 
possēs colloquī,” inquam clārē; et amōre ergā canem 
haediculamque meam atque ipsās fēlēs valdē pertentor. Prope 
paenitet mē, quod capram mātrem occīdī. Quoniam brūta animālia, 
sī modo reciprocāre amōrem possint, commūnem habent nōbīs 
sociālemque nātūram, nōlō vītam ēripere temerē. Haec cōgitāns, 
īnsuper meminī, parcere nitrātō pulverī quam sit bonum, pondus 
caprae quam fuerit molestum. Paulō post quaerēbam, cūr, sī 
vīctum terra subjicit, mālim ferārum mōre raptās vītās praedārī. 
Illa sānē quaestiō profundius in pectus dēscendit, postquam 
ūbertātem īnsulae plēnius compertam habuī. 66. Sed exsultō, et 
pāstīs animālibus, dē fabīs meīs satagō, quārum aliquās aquā 
coctās velim, prō canis cibātū. Posteā hās coquēbam cum carnis 
frustīs, cum sēbō, lārdō, dēmum piscibus vel oleō; faciēbamque 
massās quadrātās: tum sī aliunde nihil foret in promptū, hinc et 
canem et fēlēs pāscēbam. Semper dēnique hōc modō pauxillulum 
carnis aut piscium prō condīmentō adjungēbam fabīs, farīnae vel 
rādīcibus. 

67. Posterō diē, caelō serēnō et marī tranquillō, ligna 
tollēnōnis et diaetae forēs ējecta sunt in lītore; cum minōre 
dētrīmentō quam quis exspectāverit. Hās rēs, ut prīmum possum, 
citrā vim undārum trahō; dēnique in cavernās illās, dē quibus 
dīxī, dēpōnō, et quandō ab aliīs operibus vacō, restituō 
tollēnōnis ferrāmenta. Posteā hunc ad nāvāle meum cōnstituī, 
propter ūsūs scaphae. 68. Sed dē domiciliō meō multa erant 
dēcernenda. Cavernās in rūpe quō lātius explōrāveram, magis 
admīror. Ultrā numerum vidēbantur. Aliae patēbant, sine externō 
pariete, tamquam porticus aut ambulācrum; aliae angustā jānuā, 
intus camerātae, jūnctae sunt item internīs ōstiīs, ita ut tōta 
rūpēs velut spongia esse posset. 69. Contemplāns crēdidī, hās 
marī esse excavātās: nam sub pedibus pavīmentum erat saxeum, 
molliter tamquam flūctibus rotundātum, et quasi per lātissimōs 
gradūs ascendēns. Omnia mea possem hīc optimā cum disciplīnā 
dispōnere; sed dē cubiculō erat praecipuē cōgitandum; nec 
libēbat arborem meam prius relinquere, quam mūnītius quiddam 
reperīrem. 70. Illud animadvertī,—nihil saxōrum praeter lītus 
jacēre, quod ā rūpe cecidisset; et quidem ubi gelū est ignōtum, 
rārior esse dēbet tālis rūpium lābēs. Porrō pavīmenta cavernārum 
parcā tantum arēnā vestiēbantur, tamquam ventō illātā. Lacūnāria 
ferē camerāta erant, hīc atque hīc quasi stīriārum massīs 
distīncta. Aquās per rūpem stillantēs crēdiderim saxō saturātās 
fuisse. 71. Lītus externum, propius undās, algārum erat ferāx; 
internum, ultrā summōs aestūs, aliā quādam algā et cactīs 
aliīsque spīnōsīs fruticibus opplēbātur. Plūrēs hōrum in decem 
pedēs surgēbant, aliquot in quīndecim. Ex hīs silva plūrima et 
quasi umbrāculum ante cavernās praetexēbātur, nē quis ē marī vel 
ā rūpe oppositā facile intrō perspiceret. Ego autem, arreptā 
secūrī, continuam sub rūpe aperiēbam sēmitam, succīsīs cactīs 
cēterīsque, quidquid nimium obstāret. Jamque velut in meam 
vīllam mē recondō. 72. Ē cavernīs duās praesertim dēnotāvī, ūnam 
prō cubiculō, alteram prō penāriā. Utraque internum habēbat 
ōstium, per quod aura flābat salūbris. Sēnseram autem, et apud 
Maurōs et in Brazīliā, quantum nox frīgidula corpus fervōribus 
adustum fovēret atque recreāret; et sī in magicā hāc horrendāque 
īnsulā (sīc eam quandōque vacuīs oculīs contemplābar) per summōs 
calōrēs habitandum mihi foret, tāle cubiculum magnī aestimābam. 
Opera quaedam hīc meditābar, sī hūc mea omnia congererem; 
propter quod cōnsultō opus erat. 73. Marī seu terrā, ipsam 
ratem, sīve bona mea ex rate, dēdūcerem, aut perīculōsum aut 
labōriōsum fore opīnābar. Mox subit haedī cūra, cui neque 
pābulum hōc in locō habēbam neque aquam dulcem. Mihimet profectō 
aquam imprīmīs anquīrere opus erat: sed nōn diū hujus reī 
inopiam queror. 74. Etenim postquam per spīnās fruticētī longius 
patefēcī viam, et dulcem aquam et nāvāle scaphae idōneum 
inveniō. Post quīngentōs amplius pedēs abrupta humus erat, alveō 
marīnō intus penetrante, tamquam ōstiō rīvulī. Intellegō alveum 
hunc, quasi flūmen submarīnum, ad Postēs Saxeōs continuārī; 
intus autem nāvāle, mihi satis profundum, etiam in recessū 
aestūs praebērī. 75. Hunc in alveum rīvus ē terrā praeceps 
dēcurrēbat. Spatium autem praetereundī inter rūpem alveumque 
satis lātum patēbat, succīsīs modo fruticibus. Jam tollēnōnem 
mente dēstinō in margine ērigendum: sed redeō contentus in 
vallem, dē ōrdinātiōne bonōrum meōrum meditāns. 76. Omnia dē 
prīmā illā rate dētrahō dispōnōque subter quādam arbore, cum 
ipsā ratis māteriē. Latēre volēbam, sī forte quis advenīret. 
Plūrimās caedō virgās, quae facillimē ūdō in solō possint 
frondēscere, hāsque ita dēfīgō, ut quam maximē, quidquid sit 
intus, obtegant. Hūc dēdūcō haedum, velut suum in praesaepe. 
Cistās quae pecūniam, quae astrologicam supellectilem, quae 
pulverem nitrātum continēbant, hās et capsās scrīptōriās 
aliāsque rēs minōrēs, singulātim ad cavernās asportāvī: posteā 
culīnae īnstrūmentum. 

77. Post aliquot diēs, hīs rēbus ōrdinātīs, caelō serēnō, cēnseō 
dēambulandum. Caput īnfulā dēnsā, Turcārum mōre, obvolvor; quod 
quidem in Brazīliā faciēbam. Balteō pistolīsque succingor. 
Grandem cultrum plicātilem sūmō ac pēram; dein convallem ascendō 
juxtā rīpam flūminis. Novā in regiōne omnia nōn possum lēctōris 
animō subjicere, quae meīs occurrēbant oculīs; sed plūra cōnābor 
paulātim expedīre. 78. Avium versicolōrum tanta erat multitūdō, 
ut nisi in Brazīliā praereptā mihi esset admīrātiō, tunc 
obstupēscerem. Hīc autem mē praesertim alliciēbat pulcherrima 
illa avicula, quam in Occidentālibus īnsulīs Anglī aviculam 
bombilantem appellant. Plūra quidem hujus generis passim 
volitābant, item mīra pāpiliōnum varietās. 79. Immō, nōn modo 
alia prōrsus arborum, fruticum, grāminum, foliōrum genera 
appārēbant, nostrīs hominibus ignōtū, vērum etiam ferē omnis 
arbor reptātōriīs fruticibus, vītium aut hederārum ad īnstar, 
vestiēbātur; atque adeō, obruēbantur plūrimae. Ē tantā varietāte 
vix quidquam prīmō poteram agnōscere: cēterum imprīmīs anquīrō 
esculentās rādīcēs atque ignis alimentum. 80. Quidquid juncōrum 
obviam vēnit vel cannārum, medullam explōrāvī, anne idōneum 
praebēret fōmitem. Tria dēmum genera in pēram sēlēcta condidī, 
quae experīmentō probārem. Āridās sīve lignī sīve lignōsōrum 
foliōrum reliquiās celerrimā flammā ārsūrās crēdēbam. Tālis 
māteriae plūrēs asportāvī pugillōs. Rubōs quoque notāvī dūmōsque 
āridōs, ex quibus immēnsa cōpia cremandō sufficerētur. 81. Mox 
fruticem videō, quī piper gignit; sed magis gaudēbam, quod 
dioscōreās ēsculentās invēnī multās. Duo hārum genera optima prō 
certō agnōveram,—quae ālāta appellātur, et quae globōsa. 
Ulterius perscrūtāns, adeō abundāre intellegō hās rādīcēs, ut, 
sī cōnservārī possint, cibus semper futūrus sit in promptū. Jam 
cinchōnam videō arborem, colligōque rāmulōs plūrēs. Nē longus 
sim, satis sit nārrāre, mē circā hōs locōs posteā invēnisse 
medicās quāsdam herbās, quās in Brazīliā didiceram, et aliās 
quās prō condīmentīs cibōrum aestimābam. 82. Acclīvitās vallis 
augēscēbat. Vix quattuor mīllia passuum aestus marīnus in terram 
penetrat; sed modicus rīvus plūrēsque rīvulī dēscendēbant per 
plantās et arbusculās. Propius ad collēs dēnsantur generum 
dīversōrum arborēs, grandēs aliquot. Nova simul atque ārida 
folia in eādem cōnsistēbant arbore, id quod colōrēs pulcherrimōs 
contendēbat: immō, exoriēbantur frūctuum germina ipsō ē rāmō, 
unde pendēbant frūctūs putrēscentēs. 83. Quīnque vel sex mīllia 
continuāvī iter, semper ascendēns convallem. Ēn vērō, hīc locī 
seges illa pretiōsissimā blandītur oculīs, zēa virōre et aurō 
fulgēns. Plēnē mātūram crēdidī. Humī jacēbant grāna plūrima et 
siliquae. Pigēbat mē, quod major mihi pēra nōn erat in promptū. 
Quantum potuī, īnferciēbam, jamque prō certō habēbam cibum mihi 
numquam dēfore. Tandem collēs sinistrī sē dēmīsēre; atque alia 
vallis, lātior atque amoenissima, quasi hortōs viridissimōs in 
sinū suō retegit. In fronte mihi assurgēbant juga altiōra, 
montēs paene dīcerem, spissīs vestīta herbīs, ex quibus undique 
stillābant rīvulī perennēs. Arborēs frūctificās admīror, inter 
quās dispiciēns agnōscō citrōs, aureās mālōs,[F] et Assyriās 
mālōs, quās līmōnās appellāmus. Sānē jūcundissimus erat rūris 
aspectus, mēque sēnsī esse opulentum lātifundiōrum dominum. 
Utramque vallem mihi tamquam proprium prōtinus asserō, nōminōque 
priōrem convallem meam, vel Convallem Flūminis, alteram Hortōs 
meōs. 

84. Multum mē alliciēbat hortōrum amoenitās, cōpia arborum et 
dulcis aquae, dēfēnsiōque montium. Dēlīberābam dē commigrandō 
illūc, nisi quod nōllem maris prōspectum āmittere, sī nāvis 
venīret: immō, prōrsus nōluī cymbae scaphaeque ūsūs renūntiāre: 
necnōn per pluviālēs hōrās nihil cum cavernīs meīs vidēbātur 
contendere. Etenim hāc in regiōne caelī liquēbat mihi dīrissimās 
aliquandō esse expectandās procellās, quae tentōria ac domicilia 
perverterent; tālī in tempestāte nīl cavernīs esse comparandum. 
Pigēbat mē vidēre frūctūs plūrimōs et optimōs humī prōstrātōs et 
aquā putrēscentēs. Arborēs passim vim ventī prōdēbant. Sine 
dubiō autumnālēs procellae tantās fēcerant ruīnās. Sērius ego 
hōs in locōs prōcesseram, messe frūctuum praeteritā. Attamen hōc 
sub astrō tam vegeta est vīs terrae genitālis, ut novī frūctūs 
appārērent, quī mox possent mātūrēscere. Plūrēs hōrum concupīvī, 
et dē modō convehendī meditābar. 

85. Rediī ad cavernās alacer animī, cūrārum oblītus. Pēram 
opplēveram illīs rēbus quās memorāvī; loculōs autem vestium 
arōmatīs, gummīne et citreīs mālīs aliquot. Prōtinus novōs 
thēsaurōs cūrātē dīgerō. Dēnique ā cavernīs in arborem meam 
propter noctem retrō cēdere, paulō labōriōsius vidētur. 

86. Māne quum expergīscor, sentiō diērum mē āmīsisse 
computātiōnem. Nē prōrsus fierem barbarus, ad disciplīnam 
puerīlem mē redūxī. Diēs incipiō in digitīs numerāre. Quid 
ūnōquōque diē fēcerim, ego mihimet recitō; inde comperiō, quīnam 
sit hodiernus diēs. Tum volō mathēmaticus ratiōnēs retractāre. 
Dīxī mē quattuor librōs ē nāvī āvēxisse. Ūnus erat precum 
sacrārum libellus, secundum normās Papālēs: alterum erat dē 
Geōgraphiā: tertium nihil habēbat nisi numerōs ad ūsum nāvigandī 
dīgestōs: quārtus ipsam nautārum mathēmaticam tractābat. Hanc 
perlegō libenter. Quippe nōn sōlum sōlitūdine animum āvertit, 
sed absolūtius quiddam et sublīmius subjēcit cōgitantī, nē 
semper dē meīs tantummodo cūrīs satagerem. 

87. Quaerere potest lēctor, quī factum sit, ut ego, patre invītō 
nāvigāns, nauticam mathēmaticam ēdidicerim. Vidēlicet, admodum 
juvenis Londinium petiī, nāvem anquīsītūrus, in quā peregrē 
īrem. Magna mihi tunc illa fēlīcitās vidēbātur, quod hūmānissimō 
cuidam virō, nāvis magistrō, incidī, in Guineam nāvigātūrō. Is 
mē clēmentissimē exceptum, prō suō sodāle habuit; persuāsitque 
ut, quantam maximam possem conquīrere pecūniam, hanc commūtārem 
idōneā merce quālem ipse admonēbat, et apud sē collocārem. Ego 
igitur quōsdam ex amīcīs pecūniās rogābam, hīque, exōrātā mātre 
meā, fortasse etiam patre, quadrāgintā lībrās Anglicās ad mē 
remīsērunt. Eās autem magister optimus sīc administrāvit, ut, ex 
Āfricā dēmum reversus, mercem quam rettulī, nempe aureum 
pulverem, Londiniī trecentīs lībrīs Anglicīs mūtāverim. Porrō (
quod eram lēctōrī dēmōnstrātūrus) ipsō in cursū, cum 
benevolentiā vērē paternā, omnia quae nāvis magistrum scīre 
oportēret, dīligentissimē mē docēbat, praesertim astrologicōrum 
praecepta, viāsque caelum servandī. Ego sānē, tantā cāritāte 
dēlēnītus, summā industriā haec in studia incubuī, rediīque ex 
hāc expedītiōne magnopere auctus mentis vī, sīve ad 
nāvigātiōnem, sīve ad mercātūram. Atquī, Ō meam maximam 
calamitātem! amīcus ille summus meus atque alter pater, morbō 
vehemente correptus, dēcessit subitō. Hujus mē tenerā subit 
memoriā, dum praecepta mathēmaticōrum retractō, dum stēllam 
Polārem observō, locīque lātitūdinem (quam appellant astrologī) 
colligō; item dum noctibus singulīs omnium hōrologiōrum 
lībrāmenta convolūta intendō. 

88. In animō imprīmīs erat, ut Chrīstiānō mōre septimum quemque 
diem quōdammodo religiōsē observārem; enimvērō mēcum 
cōnstituēbam septēnōrum diērum opera. Sīc (crēdēbam) temporis 
computātiōnem eram servātūrus. Mox vīdī fore ut multa mē 
prohibērent ūllam praefīnītam labōrum rotam persequī; necnōn 
sine religiōsā contiōne rēs nihilī mihi erat diēs Dominicus: 
itaque ad aliam ratiōnem mē properē convertī. Novae lūnae 
observantur facillimē et paene necessāriō. Nāvis frācta erat 
nocte proximā post novam lūnam: quandō altera advēnit nova lūna, 
dēcrēvī mēcum, atque ūnum dēfōdī stīpitem propter mēnsem 
lūnārem. Posteā ēlegantius rēs administrandās cēnseō. Paxillōs 
praeparō tredecim modicōs et comparēs, gemēns identidem sī 
ūniversum annum hīc mihi dēgendum erit. In axe idōneae 
magnitūdinis tredecim forāmina terebrō, illīs paxillīs 
accommodāta. Quotiēs redit nova lūna, paxillum sōlemniter 
īnfīgō. Post lūnam tredeciēs novātam, cūnctōs extrahō paxillōs, 
grandius terebrō forāmen et grandiōrem īnserō pālum. Hic prō 
annō lūnārī valet. Mox prōcēdente lūnā, mēnstruōs paxillōs alium 
post alium restituō. Hīs cōnstitūtīs, novā quīvīs lūnā poteram 
computandō affirmāre, quīnam esset ille diēs secundum Eurōpeās 
temporis ratiōnēs. 



CAPUT (IV.) QUĀRTUM. 


89. Jam ad rēs convehendās trahulam dēcernō parāre: nam reī 
fabrīlis nōn eram imperītus. Hanc profectō artem in Brazīliā 
magnopere exercēbam, cum propter variōs ūsūs, tum quia ipse mē 
animus excitābat. Fabrīlis nempe opera valdē fuit necessāria 
nōbīs, nec servīs nigrītīs satis bene cognita. Faber noster 
lignārius, bonus ille quidem vir, malleō fortiter feriēbat, 
serrā patienter labōrābat: sed accūrātē mētīrī, coartāre 
commissūrās, immō, rēctam līneam dūcere, vix calluit; nēdum 
dēsignāre opus. Sī novam quandam casam vel officīnam struere 
oportēbat, praepropera ejus industria absurdissimīque errōrēs 
angēbant mē. Itaque hunc dum parō docēre, ipse artem discō. 
Mathēmaticā meā scientiā quālīcumque adjūtus, poteram sānē plūra 
animō mōlīrī, in chartā dēscrībere, cōnstituere, computāre. Mox 
ipsīs ferrāmentīs manū prehēnsīs, dēlīneābam, dissecābam, 
runcīnābam; nihil quod lignāriī fabrī est, intentātum relinquō. 
90. Jamque, ut dīcēbam, ad cōnfingendam trahulam mē convertō, 
quae et per arēnās et super leviōrem rūpium superficiem facile 
currat. Dōliō quōdam ligneō, quod perfrāctum erat, dētrahō 
circulōs ferreōs. Hōs, velut calceōs, trabibus duōbus brevibus 
paribusque, lēniter curvātīs, subjiciō. Suprā, simplicissimum 
cōnstituō currum, in quō vehātur onus vīribus meīs tractū nōn 
nimium. Restim addō, atque fīnītum est opus. Quoniam in recessū 
aestūs continuus erat arēnae margō ā praesaepī meō usque ad 
portum, hāc viā, quaecumque vellem, in animō erat trahere: nec 
jam manibus humerīsve portābam. Posteā domum ipsam cūrātius 
dīgerō atque excolō. 

91. Conclāvia vērō habuī nūlla; plūra quidem saepta, siquidem 
ūnaquaeque caverna, seu locus camerātus, erat prō saeptō. 
Prīncipāle saeptum ⸤meum ipsīus⸥ erat cubiculum, dē cujus 
mūnīmentīs erit dīcendum: dein penāria, prō cibō quālīcumque: 
tertium, culīna; tum, fūmārium; deinceps armāmentārium sīve 
fabrica; sextum erat mūsēum. In mūsēō librōs, hōrologia, 
astrologicam supellectilem, lībram trutināriam, māteriam omnem 
scrīptōriam repōnō, cum sellā ⸤ē tribus quās habēbam⸥ optimā. 
Hārum rērum aliquot cum pecūniā in cistīs erant: mēnsam posteā 
cōnfēcī. Septimum saeptum continēre dēbēbat ignis māteriem; 
lignārium appellābam. Octāvum prō frūctuāriō cēdēbat. Novum prō 
haedī stabulō dēstinābam. Decimum ac remōtissimum nitrātī erat 
pulveris repositōrium. 92. Cubiculum autem tāle fuit. Angustā ac 
celsā fenestrā intrābātur, cujus līmen quīnque pedēs ab externō 
solō, duōs ab internō aestimāverim. Alteram intus habēbat 
fenestram, per quam aura flābat salūbris: hanc tamen, prae multā 
meā cautiōne, trānsennā prōtēxī. Dē vāllanda externā fenestrā 
cōgitāveram; sed arboreum meum opus imitārī, in saxō nimis 
difficile vidēbātur. Plūrēs portārum fōrmās cōnsīderō, mox 
rejiciō. Puteum potius volō sub fenestrā fodere, quem ipse 
scālīs trānseam, dein scālās intus ad mē retraham. 93. Nāvālēs 
scālae merī erant gradūs ligneī, firmiter cōnstrictī fūnibus, 
quī pondus hominis tūtō sustentābant. In nāvis latere septem 
amplius dēpendēbant pedēs. Latera nunc hīs adjungō lignea, 
tantummodo ut rigōrem, nōn ut rōbur addam; nam fūnium rōbur 
sufficiēbat; sed quia flexilēs erant, id hīc erat incommodum. 
Scālae sīc refectae octo pedum habēbant longitūdinem. 94. Deinde 
ligōnēs recognōscō cūnctōs, et marrās bifurcās trifidāsque, sī 
quid hōrum possit cunīculāriae hastae vicem gerere; solum enim 
calcārium rōbustō egēbat ferrāmentō. Tālia invēnī īnstrūmenta, 
quōrum ope puteum, brevem sānē, dēfōdī sub ipsā fenestrā, duo 
tantum pedēs altum, sed quattuor amplius ā rūpe exstantem. Vecte 
ferreō, quamquam nōn acūtō, graviōra saxa āmōlītus sum, postquam 
initia penetrandī factū sunt. Tum hōc puteō adeō prōtēctus 
vidēbar, ut nē ā pardō quidem foret metuendum. 95. Illud enim mē 
cōnfirmābat, quod fēlēs ferae quae nōn ⸤nāribus cōnfīsae⸥ 
vēnantur, numquam possent conjectāre, quid in meō cubiculō 
dormīret. Ego vērō interdum serpentēs quoque formīdābam: sed 
numquam nē ūnum quidem anguem, magnum parvumve, meā in īnsulā 
vīdī; quae, velut Hibernia, sānctī Patriciī benedictiōne 
vidēbātur fruī. Stēlliōnēs erant in cavernīs, quōs fovēbam, quia 
muscās īnsectāsque comedunt: et sānē facile mānsuēscēbant. 96. 
Sī ligōnibus rēs nōn cessisset, fodīnam parātus eram nitrātō 
pulvere displōdere. Praetermīsī nārrāre, mē, postquam dōlium 
pulveris nitrātī ⸤aquā marīnā corruptī⸥ dēportāvī, intus crustam 
invēnisse dūram, intrā quam pulvis siccus erat et plānē 
incolumis. Crustam malleō comminūtam reservāvī, et prō 
experīmentō, vel lūsūs causā, aliquotiēs in pyrotechnicam 
adhibueram, diffīsus posse in aliquam ūtilitātem convertī. 
Posteā crēdēbam rūdera haec nitrāta ad fodīnās displōdendās esse 
accommodāta: igitur asservāvī, sī forte ūsus venīret. 97. 
Pulvere nitrātō eram profectō assuētissimus, dē quā rē libet 
amplius explicāre lēctōrī. Etenim dum dēgēbam in Brazīliā, 
maximō studiō ⸤missilis plumbī dīrigendī perītiam⸥ colēbam. Nec 
sānē umquam hujus exercitātiōnis fueram aliēnus; sed neque 
patriam circā urbem, neque super marī opportūnitātēs eam 
excolendī reppereram. Attamen in Brazīliā, rūre apertō, 
ingentibus silvīs, ubi prōdigiōsa īnsectārum vīs ⸤mīrificam 
avium quoque cōpiam⸥ in aeternum praestat, sī quis sub sōle 
potest esse agilis, ad avēs vēnandās ipsō agrō attrahitur. Prīmō 
habēbam ignipultam quandam ā dominō meō Maurūsiō dēreptam; mox 
meliōrēs quaesīvī, imprīmīs ex Lūsitāniā. Posteā Helvēticī 
cujusdam virī, quī Rōmae mercēnāriōrum mīlitum praefectus 
fuerat, ignipultās duās vel optimās forte potuī emere, ūnam 
duōrum tubōrum; quās quidem hujus fīlius, post patris mortem 
illātenus ēvagātus, inter aliās rēs vēndidit. Equidem ad tēla 
illa probanda in scopum aliquandō collīneābam: sed quia valdē 
incertus erat ā longinquō jactus, plūrēs ac minōrēs ūnō in tubō 
cōnferciēbam glandēs, quae, per āera dispersae, lātius ferīrent. 
Furcā item bitubam illam sustentābam, propter certiōrem ictum. 
Et quoniam grandiōrēs illīc abundābant ālitēs, ut vulturius, ut 
ferus olor, ut gruēs atque ardeae nostrīs dīversae,—nec deest 
strūthiō quīdam—hōs quoque pilulīs olōrīnīs petēbam, 
jaculandīque omnīnō perītissimus ēvāsī. Prōh caecitātem hominum! 
quippe nesciēbam quantum in sōlitāriā īnsulā haec mihi ars esset 
prōfutūra. 

98. Simul ac cubiculum satis firmāveram, voluī illūc commigrāre, 
cūnctīs cum animālibus meīs. Haedus paululum clauda erat, id 
quod nōn dolēbam: tantō minus erat mē effugitūra. At vērō trēs 
jam mihi erant haedī, dē quō nārrandum erit. Cēterum falcātō 
gladiō ⸤quidquid idōneum vidēbātur herbārum aut frondium⸥ 
dēmetēbam et convehēbam ad cavernās: multum sānē ⸤sōlī expositum 
siccātumque⸥ recondidī. Haedōs omnēs suō in stabulō composuī. 

99. Dē novīs haedīs incipit nārrātiuncula. Trahulā jam meā 
adjūtus, cupīdinem admīseram vēnandī iterum, nē canī fēlibusque 
carō dēforet. Trahulam per clīvōs clēmentiōrēs sūrsum trāxī 
super mollī brevīque herbā, ignipultam in trahulā habēns. Canem 
nōn potuī retinēre, quīn lepusculōs vēnārētur: is prōrsus 
ēvānuit. Ego ut prīmum in scopulōsum dēvēnī iter, trahulam 
omittō, inter saxa serpō. Ēmergēns capram cōnspicor cum haedīs 
ad stāgnum herbōsō in prātulō. Nōn mē fūgērunt, neque 
dēmōnstrābant metum. Dēcerpō grāmina, accēdō propius et porrigō. 
Haedī accurrunt, libenterque rōdunt. Ego cornua eōrum resticulīs 
cingō, et laqueīs bracchiō meō adnectō. Iterum iterumque dēcerpō 
grāmen, studeōque mānsuēfacere. Accurrit māter capra, grandis et 
rōbusta; haec quoque ē manū meā comēdit. Paenitēbat mē, quod 
voluissem tam cicurem animantem occīdere; nunc rōbustiōre eam 
adnectō reste. Sed ut prīmum vī sē tractam sentit, violenter 
retortō capite manū sē meā abripit, et priusquam mē possim 
recolligere, cum reste effugit. Exiguō temporis intervāllō 
convertitur. Haedōs mēcum videt, et dīrēctō cursū ⸤summō cum 
furōre⸥ mē petit. Magnum equidem sēnsī esse perīculum, nam et 
cornū incurrentis et ipse impetus lētālis esse poterat. Coāctus 
mē tuērī, dēmittor in dextrum genū, nē dēerrem, ignipultam 
cōnstantissimē dīrigēns. Vix quīndecim distābat pedēs, atque ego 
ignem ēmittō. Quamquam capite et collō trānsverberāta, plūrēs 
gressūs illō impetū ēvecta est, titubānsque ad dextram meam 
prōcubuit ēmortua. 100. Obstupēscēbam, incertus quid facerem. 
Mox capram libuit omittere, haedōs attinēre: nec longa erat ad 
praesaepe via, per ardua dēscendentī. Grāmina etiam atque etiam 
dēcerpsī recondidīque in sacculum; et sīquandō male sequerentur 
haedī, grāmen ante ōra ostentāns, alliciēbam. Hōc modō incolumēs 
dēdūxī, gaudēns praesertim quod mās et fēmina erant. Paxillīs 
celeriter prope claudam haedum advenās dēpangō, suggerō grāmina; 
tum festīnō, mātrem reportātūrus. Regressus, trahulam coāctus 
sum per asperiōra loca, ut possem, subdūcere, dum mortuam 
assequor, quam aegrē in trahulam compōnō; dein satis labōriōsē 
hanc cum ignipultā per saxōsa loca dēdūcō, mox facilius super 
clīvīs herbōsīs. Illam, ut priōrem, dēmergere in pēlvī sīve 
piscīnā volēbam, sed spurcam crēdidī: quārē nīl melius nōveram, 
quam ut in praesēns rāmīs frondōsīs corpus operīrem: etenim ligō 
et pāla nōn erant in prōmptū. 101. Jam dē ferārum audentiā 
reputāns, intellegō hominēs hāc in īnsulā esse ignōtōs. Id 
multum mē sōlātur; nam quantumvīs sōlitūdinem dētrectābam, 
barbarōs saevōsque hominēs formīdābam longē amplius. Porrō sī 
leporēs avēsque, aequē ac caprī, hominis metū vacant, sī nunc 
haec animālia facile mānsuēfīant, stultē absterrērī opīnor. 
Itaque magis magisque pulverī nitrātō parcendum dēcernō, et, 
quidquid ferārum posset, mānsuēfaciendum. 

102. Etiam congerēbam pābulum. Multās dēportābam siliquās zēā 
plēnās, et dioscōreās aliāsque rādīcēs; item cēpa, bulbōs, 
condīmenta. Caprae secundae carnem partim siccāveram fūmō, 
partim sale condīveram, nec jam dē cibō eram sollicitus. Duās 
viās ē cavernīs ad summam rūpem ligōne ac vecte tūtius jam 
mūniō; ūnam, quā prīmō illō māne, prōspectā scaphā, per 
praecipitia atque algās dēgressus sum; alteram ex portū praeter 
nāvāle meum. In difficiliōre locō ⸤stīpitēs duo firmiter 
dēfossōs⸥ fūne connectō, quō audācius sēcūriusque dēscendam; tum 
gradibus incīsīs, opus perficiō. 

103. In reportandā caprā, trahulae mē quōdammodo paenitēbat. In 
arēnīs quidem bene currēbat, item per saxa lēvia grāmine 
vestīta; sed in ferācī humō super spissīs variīsque herbīs, 
inter admixtōs fruticēs, trahere quam portāre difficilius fore 
sentiō: ad dioscōreās, ad zēam, ad citrōs aliōsque frūctūs 
convehendōs pērās sacculōsque meōsque humerōs antepōnī oportēre 
trahulae, nisi meliōrem poterō mūnīre viam: id quod mē male 
habet. Igitur ūniversam vīcīniam explōrāre cupiō.—Dīxī mē ab 
excelsō quōdam colle prōspectāsse. Hōc colle īnferior alter, quī 
cavernās meās ferē ex adversō dēspiciēbat, lītoris aspectum 
superiōrī adēmerat. Quum, ascēnsā rūpe, in īnferiōrī colle astō (
quem Speculam meam nōmināvī) admīrāns gaudēnsque propiōrem 
lītoris ōram contemplor. Ad dextram, id est, ad occidentem, 
flūminis videō ōstium, deinde portum meum, tum in fronte 
prōmontorium modicum.[G] Contrā autem ad sinistram, id est, ad 
orientem, inter humilēs rūpēs ac mare, acclīvis plānitiēs 
arboribus prōcērīs mīrē luxuriābat, palmīs praesertim. Suprā, 
pōne rūpēs, palūs quaedam seu lacus angustus extenditur: rūrsus 
super hōc novus atque excelsior rūpium ac saxōrum ōrdō, unde 
pluviās crēdō in palūdem colligī. In ōrā palūdis viridissimās 
advertō herbās, plūrimāsque avēs aquātilēs. 104. Sed ego ad 
interiōra mē convertō. Ab excelsiōre illō colle arborēs quāsdam 
in cavō locō vīderam, nōn multās illās quidem. Jam explōrāns 
perspiciō omnia praeter summās arborēs abscondita mihi tunc 
fuisse, interjectō quōdam īnferiōre grūmō. Clīvus ille montis 
quasi pēlvī erat ingente excavātus, in quam multum aquārum ex 
scopulōsā illā regiōne cōnfluit. Hae, grāminibus sustentātae, 
perpetuum sufficiēbant rīvum, quī in flūmen, nōn longē ā 
praesaepī meō, dēcurrēbat. Inde fuerat mihi prīmus ille dulcis 
aquae haustus. Hāc in pēlvī (nam proprium hujus fōrmae nōmen 
nesciō:—convallis nōn erat) cōnsistēbant arborēs plūrimae, 
Eurōpaeārum aspectum praeferentēs. Amplius posteā perscrūtātus, 
repperī hās nōn esse nostrātium ad īnstar, tamen frūctuī 
lignōque ūtilēs. Hunc locum appellō Saltum meum. 105. Hinc 
poteram ligna dēvehere, sīve ad fabrīlēs ūsūs sīve ignis grātiā, 
multō facilius quam ā flūminis convalle. Quippe grandis rāmus 
vel ipse arboris truncus, tractus seu humī dēvolūtus, ad rūpem 
erat facile dēscēnsūrus. Sīc posteā saepius rem gessī. Minōra 
ligna, quae ignī dēbēbant īnservīre, ex summā rūpe 
praecipitābam. Sed propter graviōra, quae diffringī nōlēbam, 
rōbustam dēlēgī arborem, ipsum ad marginem, unde magis praeceps 
erat rūpēs. Cursuī tum dēvolventis lignī, fūne circā hujus 
stīpitem contortō, moderor ac temperō, dōnec ad fundum pervenit. 
Sed haec post aliquot mēnsēs. 

106. Quō melius intellegat lēctor meārum rērum statum, dē sitū 
īnsulae et varietāte tempestātum quaedam sunt dīcenda. Īnsulae 
lātitūdinem (quod Geōgraphī appellant) satis compertam habeō: 
poteram sānē in stēllā Polārī observandā errāre, sed nōn multum: 
gradūs, crēdō, habēbat duodecim (12°) ab aequinoctiālī circulō, 
Septentriōnēs versus. Dē longitūdine nihil prō certō cōnfirmāre 
ausim: arbitror tamen atque autumō eandem esse atque īnsulae 
quam Portum Opulentum (Porto Rico) appellant Hispānī. Nostrīs 
vērō in chartīs nihil omnīnō hīc dēnotābātur: porrō quaenam sit 
meae īnsulae longitūdō geōgraphica, minimē nunc rēfert. Propter 
tempestātum nōtitiam satis est tenēre, bis in annō sōlem super 
verticem īnsurgere, ultimō ferē Aprīlis diē, sextōque ferē 
Sextīlis. Intrā hōs continuātur aestās, quae tamen imbribus 
satis violentīs dīviditur. Imber quotīdiānus ac modicus ferē ad 
fīnem Jūniī mēnsis cadit, sed ipsō in fīne est sānē immodicus. 
Post hoc siccitās et calor subsequitur. Maximōs autem calōrēs in 
tertiā ferē parte hujus aestātis pōnō; vel, sī ad amussim 
dēnotandum est, trīgintā sex diēs ab Īdibus Quīntīlibus perdūrat 
aestuōsum tempus. Hōs intrā diēs rārior est pluvia. Quiēscit 
ventus trīduum vel quatriduum; tum vespertīnus turbō sānē 
violentus, attamen grātissimus, āera recreat. Hic rērum ōrdō 
fervōribus moderātur, longō mēnse amplius. Tandem summa aestās 
disturbātur et quasi convellitur horrendīs et pervicācissimīs 
turbinibus, sēriōrī in parte Sextīlis. Hinc procellōsum illud 
mare, quod nostram abripuit nāvem. In Februāriō item mēnse 
dēbent expectārī procellae; sed neque hārum tempus praefīnīrī 
potest neque violentiā comparēs sunt aestīvīs. In tempestāte 
procellōsā abundant fulgura, post quae frīgus ossa penetrat. Sed 
haec frīgora sī excipiās, jūcundissima est āeris temperiēs. 
Pluvia ut plūrimum cadit tenuis ac dulcissima trēs vel quattuor 
hōrās ūnōquōque māne per plūrēs annī mēnsēs. Nisi per tonitrua, 
veste ad dēfendendum frīgus nōn opus est, sed contrā sōlem 
vestiendus es. Attamen post nimium fulgur Caurus ventus plūrēs 
per diēs mīrum frīgus incutit, sed semper citrā gelū. Nec 
calōrēs conqueror. Lūsitānum vel Anglum hominem equidem crēdō, 
sī neque tēmētum imbibat et carne parcissimē vēscātur, (id ipsum 
apud Maurōs didicī,) tōtum per annum posse labōrāre salūbriter, 
modo per maximōs fervōrēs prūdentiam adhibeat. In hieme certē (
id est, dum sōl ā merīdiē stat) sī nimium exuāris vestīmentōrum 
onus, ipsīs in Angliā Anglīs ad labōrem pār eris. Spīrante Caurō 
post fulgura, lacernā, ac spissā quidem, carēre neutiquam potuī: 
ignem aliquotiēs fovēbam, sed rārō. 

107. Ego autem quōdam diē quum pluvia mātūrē dēstiterat, cymbam 
ingredior rēmigōque nōn sine timōre circum illud prōmontorium 
quod caeruleam terminat rūpem. Plūrimās palmās videō, quās 
crēdidī ejus esse pretiōsissimī generis, quod vulgō Nux Cocus 
appellātur. Multae aliae arborēs fruticēsque mihi ignōtī illīc 
stābant, sed ipse lītoris acervus Portum meum referēbat. Tantum 
omnia hīc ampliōra atque ūberiōra. Dē algā saepius memorāvī. 
Aliud nōmen nōn succurrit; etenim nostrātibus virīs rēs ipsa 
ignōta est. Hīc dēnotō, algās illās, ut plūrimum, nōn marīnās 
fuisse, sed maritimās, ultrā summum aestūs terminum. Hī 
rēptantēs erant fruticēs, dīversī generis; hibiscōs, acanthōs, 
conjectūrā dīxerim. Sānē erant pulcherrimī, pūrīs distīnctī 
foliōrum ac flōrum colōribus. 108. Dēambulō in lītore, cocōs 
admīror: multum cōgitō ac vēscor spē. Subitō meminī rēmōs vel 
optimōs ē cocī truncō fierī, scaphamque meam rēmīs carēre. 
Secūrim mēcum habuī. Ūnam ē minimīs cocīs statim exscindō atque 
obtruncō. Caput hujus in cymbam congerō, ipsam dēstinō fūne 
trahendam. Sed quum volō redīre, aestūs recessus mē impedit: nam 
circā prōmontorium, ubi fuerat mare, nunc saxa longius 
excurrēbant, quae metuō circumīre, nē in prōfluentem aliquam 
marīnam implicer. Tandem super saxīs ingrediēns, flexuōsum 
reperiō iter aquae, in quō cymba natāre possit. Hanc trahō, 
saxīs ipse īnsiliēns. Posteā truncum illum super humerīs asportō 
per eandem viam; mox, cymbam ingressus, mē atque mea omnia domum 
laetus reportō. 



CAPUT (V.) QUĪNTUM. 


109. Pluvia quotiēs caderet, intus mē abdidī, et in excolendā 
domō satis habuī operis. Armāmentārium meum praesertim cum 
exultātiōne cordis aspiciēbam. Arma igniāria cūncta, rīte 
ēmundāta, perfricāta oleō, hāmīs ad mūrōs suspendī. Mēnsam 
fabrīlem suō in locō cōnstituī; jūxtā hanc, repositōrium 
fabrīle: in angulō, ferrāmenta agrestia. Quotīdiē suum quidque 
in locum sevērissimē repōnō, experientiā doctus sīc facillimē 
quidque invenīrī, ubi festīnātō opus est. 110. Porrō in penāriā 
ac culīnā multa ōrdināvī. Scālās quās ad cubiculum intrandum 
adhibēbam, compāgī cuidam ligneae per hāmōs ānulōsque sīc 
annexuī, ut, super hīs astāns, carnem suprā ⸤procul fēlibus 
suspēnsam⸥ possem attingere; possem quoque disjungere scālās, 
quotiēs vellem. Quandō mēmet objūrgō propter nimiam carnis 
cupīdinem, respondeō, mē ipsīs fēlibus cōnsulere, nē suum ipsae 
cibātum dēperdant. In penāriam cellam dōlia item atque arcās 
plūrēs collocāvī: aliās quidem in frūctuāriō meō. Cēterum prō 
culīnā sūmpseram ejusmodī cavernam, cujus in angulō erat quasi 
focus nātūrālis. Rīmam quandam vīdī, per quam fūmus exīre 
poterat: hanc ferreō vecte ampliō. Porrō forāmen majus effodiō 
suprā, nē fūmus per culīnam vagārētur. Exībat autem in alteram 
minōrem cavernam, quam prō fūmāriō dēstinābam. Hīc carnem 
suspendō, sīquam indūrātam velim. Tum fūmus, hōc modō diffūsus, 
minus erat mē prōditūrus: nam velut nebula in rūpe poterat 
vidērī. In lignāriō autem meō, quidquid lignī ex nāve 
dēportāveram, et quidquid māteriem ignis habēbat, illud omne 
repōnēbam. Vēla quoque hūc dēposuī, sed parum contentus locō. 

111. Dē corpore cūrandō quaedam sī nārrem, ignōscet lēctor. Quae 
sequuntur, plūrēs ad mēnsēs, immō annōs, pertinent. Dīxī mē sub 
aquā marīnā, post tertium in īnsulā diem, vestēs immundās 
lapillīs oppressisse. Posteā reputābam,—sī vel sāpōnem habērem, 
operae nōn fore pretium hās nostrō mōre in splendōrem recolere. 
Spurcitiem vestīmentōrum nōn ē colōre cōnsistere, ātra essent an 
candida, sed ē cutis excrēmentō, quod quidem salsā maris aquā 
optimē āmovērētur: manibus autem ac sāpōne fricātās, dēterī 
vestēs. Quāpropter hās ipsās, sōle siccātās, iterum posteā 
induēbar. Deinde etiam simpliciōrem excōgitāvī viam.—Postquam 
expertus sum, vespertīna natātiō quantum reficeret corpus, 
dēcernō, sub sōlis occāsum ūnōquōque vespere, ipsā in tunicā, 
cum fēminālibus linteīs ac tībiālibus[H] (id est, tegumentīs 
crūrum gossypīnīs) dēnatāre in portū meō. Ēgressus aquā, exuor 
vestīmenta, contorqueō manibus, suspendō, alia induor. Illa 
altera māne sicca inveniō. Itaque recente semper vestītū 
pernoctor. Sānē per summās pluviās aegerrimē siccābantur rēs: 
tālī in tempestāte madidās vestēs in culīnā suspendēbam. 

112. Praetereā, cutī fricandae dō operam, neque caesariem 
prōrsus negligō. Sciēbam enim, inter barbarōs, sī qua sit gēns 
sānitāte, prōcēritāte, decōre corporis īnsignis, hanc praesertim 
cutī cūrandae semper dedī; sīn autem mē illuviēī permīserō, in 
nūllam nōn spurcitiem posse dēlābī. Equidem ē nāve meās habēbam 
mappās atque mantēlia cum sūdāriīs. Mappae dētergendae corporī 
nimium lēvēs erant; mox in calōribus hās adhibuī ad genās 
prōtegendās, Arabum Scēnītārum mōre. Mantēlia, ut quae villōsa 
maximē, dum dūrābant, prae cēterīs approbābam.—In capillōrum 
supellectile nihil egomet habueram, praeter ūnum pectinem atque 
ūnam scōpulam sētōsam: sed totidem, quae magistrī nāvis erant, 
āvēxī, plūrēsque nautārum pectinēs. Nautīs scōpulae nūllae 
erant. Scōpulās equidem magnī aestimābam; nam diffīsus sum posse 
reparārī. Barbae, ipsā in nāve, semper prōmittēbantur; nec in 
meā īnsulā mē rādēbam, quamquam habērem novāculās; sed forfice 
identidem tondēbam leviter aut capillōs aut barbam. 

113. In tempestāte procellōsā, praesertim post fulgura, propter 
frīgus Caurī, quotiēs dēsisterem ab opere, lacernam induēbar, 
nec spernēbam ignis sōlātium. Sed tum maximē poteram labōrāre. 
Nova grāmina aut rādīcēs aut viridem zēam, optimā caule 
meliōrem, aut ligna reportābam; porrō utrumque trāmitem quō in 
summam rūpem ēvādēbam, comparābam in melius. Quippe rubram super 
rūpem spērābam fore ut trahula tandem subīret. Quōdam diē imber 
superveniēns īnfulam capitis meam hūmōre saturāvit, et, tergō 
profūsē madidō, caurus ventus ācerrimum mihi frīgoris sēnsum 
incussit. Domum cucurrī magis quam incessī, mūtātīsque 
vestīmentīs dēlīberābam. Sērica mea umbella ē nāve in prōmptū 
erat; sed ubi manūs esse dēbērent līberae, hāc ūtī nōn possem. 
Inter pluviās nimium sēnsī sōlis fervōrem, nec īnfulā potuī 
carēre. Hīc omnia nārrābō quae excōgitāvī, quamquam plūrēs per 
mēnsēs. 

114. Caprārum pellēs servāveram. Sānē mollēs erant et dēlicātae. 
Hārum laciniās duās commodā magnitūdine abscīdī, quae prō 
cucullō forent. Jūnxī suprā, ā fronte usque ad occiput; inde per 
cervīcēs dēfluere permīsī. Ipsā in dorsī spīnā duplicēs 
cadēbant, contrā pluviās sōlemve umbrāculum. Caput atque adeō 
īnfulam comprehendēbant artē. Quoniam fēmineae quās habēbam acūs 
tenuēs nimis erant fragilēsque, idcircō sarcināriās adhibēbam 
acūs cum tenuissimīs fūniculīs: hīs satis bene cōnsuēbam. Sed 
depsere volō internam cutem, quod quidem artificium parum 
cognōveram. Ego autem cinchōnam aquā dēcoxī lentō igne, ut aquae 
remanēret quam minimum, quam maxima autem foret ejus potentia. 
Mox īnfūdī in ferreum artillātōris ferculum; superpōnō pellem, 
ut interior pars imbibat cinchōnam. Post bīduum, longulō ac lēvī 
lapide, quem prō magide[I] aestimābam, oleum pice imbūtum 
imprimō atque īnfricō in pellem: jamque prō depstā accipiēbam. 

115. Etiam summīs in calōribus vix sufficiēbat tunica,[J] nam 
contrā īnsectās tībiālibus[K] erat opus. Sed dorsī quoque 
tegumentō carēre nēquāquam conveniēbat; id quod probē sciunt 
Lūsitānī. Atque erat mihi sagulum Lūsitānum vel optimum, nisi 
quod propter nigrum calōrem radiōs sōlis imbiberet: quārē aut 
albīs testīs marīnīs aut spīnīs fortasse hystriceīs vellem sānē 
dorsum obtexere. Jam, quotiēs humerīs quidpiam portandum erat 
saltem asperum ac grave, suffarcināmentum dēsīderābam, nē 
excoriārentur ossa. Intellēxī spissā tegete esse opus, quae 
humerōs, sī onus portārem, dēfenderet; porrō sōlem pluviamve 
repelleret, nec imbiberet calōrem. 116. Tāle tegumentum dēmum 
contexuī, postquam juncōs cannāsque īnsulae paulō melius 
cognitōs habērem; neque ūllō vestīmentō superbīvī magis. Contrā 
calōrēs superficiem tegetis madefaciēbam; inde frīgus 
grātissimum mē recreābat. Item mappās ac lintea ⸤quantum possem⸥ 
reservāns, rōscidīs foliīs callidē obvolūtīs amicior caput, 
ūnāque dēligō fasciā sīve taeniā. Quotiēs ex labōribus ac calōre 
requiēscerem in umbrā, poteram, dētractā īnfulā, crīnēs 
madefacere: tum vērō assūmēbam cingulum, nē in vīscera 
admitterem frīgus. Sīc caput frīgidulum erat, corpus tepidum. 

117. Scapham autem, mēnse Decembrī nōndum fīnītō, gestiō 
īnstruere. Cocī truncum, quem dēportāveram, cortice exūtā, 
difficulter sānē secundum longitūdinem dissecāveram serrā, et in 
rēmōrum fōrmam magis magisque caedēbam. Etenim cymbae rēmī 
tamquam prō exemplāre prōstābant. Ad rēmigandam quidem scapham 
sex hominēs cum sex rēmīs adhibēbāmus, quattuor ad minimum. Ego, 
ūnus homō, duo ingentēs rēmōs mōliēns, nihil possem contrā 
flūctūs vel contrā prōfluentem maris facere: attamen restāgnante 
marī ac ventō, ūnus prope dēbilis rēmex aliquantum ūsuī foret. 
118. Circā Kalendās Jānuāriās serēnissimā in tempestāte mālō 
vēlōque scapham īnstrūxī. Ancoram ejus cum ancorālī atque illā 
arcā, item tollēnōnis ferrāmenta, jamdūdum ex arēnīs 
recuperāveram. In portū saepius exercēbam tum vēla, tum rēmōs; 
hōsque in melius figūrābam. Quōrsum haec, nesciēbam equidem: 
enimvērō nisi perquam lēnī aurā nōn audērem exitum; sed in 
scaphā vidēbar quasi novam quandam tenēre vim, necnōn ipsam 
nāvigandī artem inānī amōre fovēbam. Mox operae, quam prius in 
scaphā nāvāveram, diffīsus, iterum carīnam sarcīvī. Ubicumque 
rīmās metuō, argillam pice oblitum firmissimē īnferciō, dōnec 
omnia vidērentur tūtissima. 

119. At marīnās prōfluentēs, sī quae essent requiēscente ventō, 
volēbam propter scaphae salūtem cognōscere. Hās ut explōrārem, 
clēmentissimō sub ventō, ulterius ⸤merīdiem versus⸥ in cymbā 
prōcessī. Ecce autem, quandō duo amplius mīllia eram ā terrā, 
jugum montis longē altius quam excelsus ille collis ā quō ter, 
quater prōspexeram. Ab hōc monte terram opīnābar sēnsim dēsidēre 
usque ad hortōs meōs. Jam videō, sī īnsulam ac maria rēctē 
prōspectāre vellem, montem illum esse cōnscendendum; idque 
meditor. Posteā recordor, mē ipsō ā colle eundem vīdisse montem, 
sed tantam esse ejus altitūdinem tunc nōn suspicātum. 120. 
Quamquam neque mītēs vellem ferās timōre meī implēre, neque 
prōdigere nitrātum pulverem, dēcernō tamen exercendam esse 
jaculandī artem, nē oblīvīscar, nēve ipsa arma rōbīgine 
corrumpantur. Versicolōrēs quidem avēs, quālēs ferē inveniēbam, 
vix mē fugiēbant; sed aquāticae quaedam volucrēs, nostrīs nōn 
valdē dissimilēs, omnī āstūtiā ac metū ēvādēbant mē. Hās crēdidī 
advenās esse, assuētāsque hominibus: praecipuam eārum sēdem 
posteā cōnspicātus sum. Ego autem hās prō cibō et propter tēlī 
exercitātiōnem occīdō. Anatēs erant, ānserēs, olōrēs, plūmīs 
fōrmīsque nōn omnīnō nostrārum ad īnstar, porrō plūrium inter sē 
generum. Hās, ut plūrimum, plumbulīs in ōrā tantum maritimā 
petēbam, nē tēlī fragor cēterās terrēret ferās: canis autem, 
sīve in terram sīve in aquam dēciderent, ācerrimē eās 
reportābat. Sī prōtinus comedere nōn placēret, nec egērem quō 
canem pāscerem, in fūmāriō suspendēbam. Quippe fūmus et 
mātūrābat carnem et putrēdinem āvertēbat. Assae potius quam aquā 
coctae mihi placēbant; sed carbōnem, Anglōrum mōre, altē 
exstruere nequīvī. Suprā ignem assāre necesse erat: quārē 
ālitem, membrātim concīsum, fīlīs ferreīs, tamquam verubus, 
trājectum, vīvās suprā prūnās ambūrēbam. 

121. Eōdem ferē tempore columbās quāsdam facillimē nancīscor. 
Dum colle regredior obambulāns, ālārum strīdōrem audiō: mox 
conversus volātum quasi columbārum agnōscō. Hae avēs in cavum 
saxī locum sē recēpēre, quem oculīs facile notāvī, crēdidīque mē 
posse illūc ascendere. Postquam cūncta conjectandō ēmēnsus sum, 
virgam arboris ⸤abscissam prō signō⸥ terrae īnfīgō: tum domum 
redeō meditāns. Quantum possum celerrimē columbāriam cellam, 
perlevem illam quidem, compangō: hanc humerō portāns eundem 
locum repetō, post bīduum. Virga illa ēminēns fit index; saxum 
ascendō, plūrēsque in cavīs inveniō nīdōs, quibus ōva nōndum 
inerant. Ūnum nīdum in columbāriam meam cellam trānsferō; mox 
advolāvit columba, intrāvitque cellam nīdum repetēns. Id gaudeō, 
et relinquō cellam. Post plūrēs diēs reversus avem nīdō 
īnsidentem inveniō: quam ipsā cum cellā mōtū clēmentissimō 
reportō domum; atque illa intrepida manēbat. Conjunx posteā 
subsecūtus est: ambōbus, ut poteram, quotīdiē dabam cibātum. 
Posteā turriculam cōnfēcī columbāriam, columnae innīxam, 
sēcūritātis ergō: nec pullōs volēbam mactāre, sed in spem 
ampliōris prōlis reservābam. 

122. Cibī quidem satis superque mihi erant, sī modo convehere 
possem. Sed quō magis rūminor, labōrem dēportandōrum frūctuum 
horreō magis. Haedōs in praesaepe redūxeram, nē grāminibus 
quoque congerendīs dēfatīgārer; tamen ⸤illā in convalle 
dēpressā⸥ oneribus gravābar, neque trahulam poteram adhibēre, 
propter novārum herbārum luxuriem. Dē tractōriīs jūmentīs paene 
dēspērāvī, vidēbarque in servitūtem labōriōsissimam dēvōtus; sīn 
requiem captō, prōtinus mēns fīēbat miserior. 

123. Accēdēbat quod calceāmentīs dēficiēbar. Nautae super nāve 
aut nūdīs pedibus aut tenuissimīs soleīs agēbant. Caligās ego et 
magister nāvis habēbāmus, sed ego magnitūdine pedum superābam. 
Porrō saepius ex necessitāte mare ingredientī, corium caligārum 
sē contrāxerat. Ego autem post trēs labōriōsōs diēs, pedibus 
aeger, nōlēbam exīre. Omnium rērum mē taedēbat. Nova lūna jam 
intrāverat. Axem ego quadrātam coepī incīdere, īnscrīptiōnem 
quasi sepulcrī dēsignāns. Tālis erat: 

Rebilius Crūsō, 
Anglōrum cīvis,
Maurōrum captīvus,
Braziliēnsis colōnus,
Hīc naufragus sōlitārius,
Hominum miserrimus,
Quīntum jam mēnsem ēnecor. 

Illud iterāvī ter quaterque, hominum miserrimus. At subitō vōcem 
quandam sēnsī, nōn auribus, sed corde: “Tūne omnium miserrimus? 
Tū, quī summā pāce frueris, in pulcherrimā ūberrimāque īnsulā, 
sānō validōque corpore! At nē tē Deus Maurīs iterum praedam 
prōjiciat vel morbō feriat!” 124. Cohorruī. Tum reputābam: “Anne 
hoc illud est, quod vātēs sacrī summā in sōlitūdine afflātum Deī 
quaerēbant? Numne igitur mē quoque intrat ille afflātus?” Mīrē 
profectō agitābar. Dein mēmet increpuī: “Ō fatue Rebilī, sānae 
nōn es mentis. Imāgināriā sapientiā vērāque dēlīrātiōne 
capiēris, sī dīvīnam crēdēs tē audīre vōcem.” Prōtenus velut 
dēmortuus hominibus, vīvus necessāriē cōram Creātōre meō, mīrā 
quādam ac novā audentiā illum compellābam, et quasi vōtum 
concipiō. “Ō Suprēme! quisquis es (inquam), nimius tū es mihi: 
pavēscō fānāticam dēmentiam. Sed dulcem redde hominum aspectum; 
tum prūdentius tē cognōverō, plēnius venerābor.” Post haec 
tranquillior fīēbam: sed perīculōsa esse sēnsī intervālla 
industriae, nisi oblectātiōne aliquā sōlārer. Quārē pictam avem 
psittacum, sī possim, capere ac mānsuēfacere dēcernō, sī forte 
mēcum colloquātur. Dē macacō[L] cōgitāveram; sed timuī hās 
bēstiās, nē malignō forent ingeniō: sānē aliōrum generum aliī 
sunt mōrēs: itaque hoc cōnsilium dēposuī. 

125. Mox leporēs quoque volō capere. Quippe saepius captāveram, 
neque ars mea prōcesserat. Leporēs illī (seu rēctius cunīculī: 
ita crēdō: sed quia carō leporem potius referēbat, idcircō ex 
prīmā illā nocte leporēs semper appellāveram;) attamen 
gallīnārum domesticārum mōre sē gerēbant. Quam proximē sinēbant 
mē adīre, tangere nōn sinēbant; sed in cava terrae prōrumpentēs, 
inde mē intuēbantur. Laqueōs īnstrūxeram plūrēs, sed frūstrā: 
jam piscandō experiendum esse arbitror. Super nāve flagra 
aliquot rōbusta erant, quae (nam fatendum est) ad flagellandōs 
nigrītās comportābāmus, sī ratiō tulisset. Hōrum tria 
offenderam, āvēxīque propter lōrōrum ūsūs. Nunc ūnīus in fīne 
hāmum piscātōrium grandiōrem affīgō. 126. Virgam quoque praeparō 
tamquam piscātōriam, sed breviōrem, resticulā īnstrūctam: huic 
fasciculum tenerārum herbārum adnectō. Trēs sacculōs super 
humerō portāns cum virgā flagrōque, leporum adeō locōs. Sinistrā 
fasciculum jactāns, ad lūdum alliciō. Post paulō lepus incipit, 
ut fēlium catulī, persequī fasciculī cursum ac grāmina ejus 
subinde rōdere. Flagrum ego dextrā tenēns, opportūnitātem reī 
gerendae opperior, subitōque prōjectō hāmō, super caudā leporem 
opprimō. Cōnfestim arreptum attineō, sacculōque immersum. Tantōs 
ille ciet strepitūs, ut cēterī accurrant mīrābundī; dumque 
obstupēscunt, alterum verbere hāmī assequor. Animadvertō marem 
esse ac fēminam; quārē satis habeō, laetusque dēvehō praedam. 
Sub rūpe ubi cava loca abundābant, crēdō nōn male habitātūrōs; 
posteā ad mānsuēfaciendōs operam adhibuī. 

126* Dē calceāmentīs pauca sunt explicanda. Quoniam labāscēbant 
omnium caligārum coria, sēnsī validiōre esse opus tegumentō 
pedum: idque juncīs ac lentā quādam cortice plicātīs concinnāvī. 
Ē juncīs, quōs ⸤dīversī generis plūrimōs⸥ in sōle siccāveram, 
eōs dēligō quī lentī simul et relūcentēs vidērentur: nam 
quidquid relūcēret, id caunārum mōre pluviās optimē rejectūrum 
crēdidī. Ex hīs plicāvī marsūpium, cujus fōrma erat pedis īnstar 
ā convexō ad calcem praecīsī. Dein ē corticibus, quās 
mācerāveram, lōra plicāvī, lāta minus duo digitōs. Veterum 
caligārum fundum vel soleam sub marsūpiō illō positum, dum pēs 
meus inerat, lōrīs illīs circumligāvī, nōdāvīque super tālō. 
Rudis sānē hic calceus erat, attamen aliquātenus certē pedem 
prōtēxit vulneribus. Nōn absurdum erit hīc dīcere, mē ipsā in 
Brazīliā contrā īnsectās saepe Persicōs gestāsse socculōs, ē 
tapēte factōs. Per hōs nōn possunt culicēs mordēre, sed spīnae 
sentēsque facile penetrant. 



CAPUT (VI.) SEXTUM. 


127. Circā Īdūs Jānuāriās ad montem explōrandum accingor. 
Lacernam capiō cibumque, sī forte pernoctārī opus sit. 
Mollissimōs induor calceōs: prōspeculum adnectō balteō. Adsūmō 
canem. Sed ante exortum sōlem ēdūcō haedōs, et (quod mōris meī 
erat) commodō in locō paxillīs dēstinō. Tum ex convalle 
dextrōrsum surgēns juxtā aquam dēsilientem pergō, saltum versus 
meum. Sed ascendō jugum, quō lātius prōspectem, saltumque subtus 
in laevā faciō. Modica erat acclīvitās, sed continua. Sub soleā 
mihi breve erat grāmen,—molle, frīgidulum, nōn impediēns. Quō 
magis īnsurgēbam, largior erat aura ac plēna vigōris. Facile 
līberēque incēdēbam. Dextrā, caprōrum videō scopulōs ac pāscua; 
sed ad sinistram magnō flexū redeō, dein convallem flūminis 
nōtam attineō suprā, moxque hortōs meōs. Hōs simul ac 
praeterīveram, sinistrōrsum lēnī dēflexū contendēbam, incēpīque 
ipsum montem oblīquē ascendere. Jamque intellēxī, longē facilius 
hōc cursū ⸤quamvīs longō⸥ hortōs adīrī; nam propter aurās 
montānās, siccius solum, breviōrēs herbās, nōn modo nōn 
dēfessus, immō recreātus sum itinere. Ubi aquula quaedam ā monte 
dēsilit, canis incipit lambere. Sīc monitus, cibīs commūnicātīs, 
vēscor bibōque. 128. Ut prīmum monte dē summō prōspexī, 
praegestiēns cūncta admīror. Valdē praeceps erat mōns occidentem 
ac Septentriōnēs versus, id est, ad mare. Ipsa aetheris clāritās 
extentusque Ōceanus pulcherrima erant. At ego propius 
circumspectō alterum in latus, unde clēmentissimē surgēbat tanta 
altitūdō, illam vallem lūstrātūrus in quā superne hortī erant 
meī. Penitus dēspicere nequīvī, sed per oppositōs clīvōs cursum 
ejus usque ad mare indāgō. Aestus tunc quam maximē recesserat; 
laetus tamen animadvertō rīvum sē in mare effundentem, duōsque 
⸤quasi hujus tribūtāriōs⸥ dē dīversīs rīpīs rīvulōs, quōrum 
utervīs scapham meam possit excipere. Per prōspeculum 
dispiciēns, facile vīdī palmās astāre praegrandēs ⸤ōstium rīvī 
versus⸥ et paene ad ōram maris. Postquam illāc satiāvī oculōs, 
conversus in aliam terrae regiōnem aspectō. Vasta hīc subjecta 
est silva usque ad ultimum īnsulae lītus. Dēclīvitās modica 
erat, nec continua: quīndecim mīllia silvae ad minimum haec 
aestimābam. Nē prōspeculī quidem ope ultimārum poteram arborum 
nātūram cognōscere, cēterum proximae ultimaeque valdē erant 
dissimilēs. Ad Aquilōnēs Juga Caprīna (sīc enim nōminābam) 
scaenam conclūdēbant, sed mare superēminēbat. 129. Haec dum 
commeditor, prōspectōque circumcircā, repente terram ē longinquō 
videor vidēre merīdiem versus. Dispiciō, anne sit nebula. Etiam 
atque etiam contemplor: dēmum agnōscō lātissimē porrēctam 
terram, valdē humilem, sed terram tamen. Prīmō mē spē illud ac 
gaudiō affēcit. Continentem Americae merīdiānam esse prōnūntiō: 
mox fateor, nihil id ad mē. Etenim tālis regiō sōlitūdō est 
vastior, foedior, immānior longē quam haec est īnsula. Fac 
abesse barbarōs hominēs panthērāsque; at illīc sī forem, aut in 
lātissimā atque inhūmānā arēnā prōjicerer, aut (quod crēdō 
potius) in aggeribus silvōsīs maximī alicujus fluviī, inter 
palūdēs immēnsās atque īnsalūberrimōs vapōrēs. Sānē haec īnsula 
prae continente illā tamquam Paradīsus est. 130. Retorqueō 
oculōs meum versus rēgnum, contentus, laetiorque; tum dīrēctā 
incipiō viā dēscendere, dōnec tōta mihi vallis patet. Mox hortōs 
meōs cōnsīderāns, fruticēs observō grossulāriīs[M] nōn 
dissimilēs, quibus propiōrēs clīvī distīnctī sunt. Hōs versus 
dīrigō gradum. Magis magisque ūvidum inveniō hoc latus jugī, 
velut spongiam; id quod rīvum perennem prōmittit, herbīs 
pluviālem aquam multōs per mēnsēs sustentantibus. Fruticēs autem 
illī in sicciōre stābant ōrā, quamquam prope ad ūmida. Vītēs 
recognōscō, et ūvās crēdō posse suā in tempestāte hinc dēferrī. 
Porrō crūda māla citrea colligō plūra līmōnāsque ad dēliciās 
bibendī. 

131. Regredior paulātim dēscendēns, dōnec ad jūnctūram vallium 
pertingō. At ipsō in laevō vallis latere quasi viam nātūrālem 
caespite obductam cōnspicor, quae dēclīvitāte perquam modicā 
⸤saltum versus meum⸥ dūcit. Per hanc libet dēgredī. Nusquam 
minus decem pedēs lāta erat. Suprā ad laevam, īnfrā ad dextram, 
clīvus satis arduus erat, herbīs multōrum generum abundāns, sed 
in fundō arboribus cōnsitus dēnsissimīs. Agnōvī prōtinus, 
facillimē posse in trahulā meā ex hortīs hāc viā frūctūs ad 
rūpēs super cavernīs dēvehī; nam caespes erat brevis, dūrissimō 
in solō atque (ut arbitrābar) calcāriō; jamque ūnō in cōnspectū 
prope tria mīllia viae hujus patēbant. Dēambulāns alacer, saltum 
tandem meum in laevā praetereō, mox dēsilientem illum rīvulum 
assequor, videōque nōn posse trahulam sine ponte hāc trānsīre. 
Sed tālem pontem nōn magnī esse operis jūdicō. 

132. Praeclārum sānē vidēbātur hujus diēī iter. Laetus, atque 
idcircō līberālior, trīticō atque hordeō Eurōpaeō columbās 
largiter pāscō. Hās frūgēs ⸤in sacculīs conditās⸥ ē nāve 
asportāveram, sed parvī aestimābam; nunc columbīs largior. Neque 
umquam sānē hās avēs neglēxī, sed inter famulōs reputāns, plūs 
minusve cibī impertiēbam. 133. In ūniversum aestimantī, trēs 
partēs ⸤nātūrā dīversās⸥ īnsula exhibēbat,—frūctiferam, 
sterilem, silvestrem. Sterilia ac sicca Caprīnum opīnor Jugum 
collēsque vel grūmōs inde porrēctōs usque ad portum meum: ultrā 
Jugum quidnam fuerit, nōndum vīderam. Spatiō longē minimō 
fortasse erat frūctifera; sed ubi tantae silvae, ibi frūgēs 
aliquandō esse possent. 

134. Equidem postquam sēnsī quantō cum labōre rādīcēs ēsculentās 
ē convalle humerīs portem, placuit cymbā dēvehere, sī cum aestū 
maris flūmen ascendere possem. Quōdam diē hōs propter ūsūs 
solitō mātūrius illātenus ascenderam, ubi quaedam humō nāscentia 
colligerem; tum, nisi contrā aestum mē dēfatīgāre vellem, duās 
ferē hōrās erat cōnsīdendum. Quārē cymbā trānsgressus flūmen, 
regiōnem ex Occīdente oppositam explōrō. Ōstium versus flūminis 
valdē praeceps erat rīpa, sed ubi aestus maris dēsinit, lēniōrem 
habēbat clīvum. Collis calcārius esse vidēbātur, alterī illī 
super cavernīs meīs simillimus. 135. Simul ac culmen attigī, 
mare versus omnia esse praecipitia intellegō. In brevibus herbīs 
prōstrātus, caput ultrā marginem rūpis prōtendō, ejusque rādīcēs 
subtus videō undīs etiamnum lavārī. Ulterius ad Septentriōnēs 
surgēbat mōns īnsulae ille altissimus, quam explōrāveram. 
Celeriter ea vīdī quae maximī erant, redeōque properus. 136. Vix 
attingō cymbam, atque trēs cōnspicor psittacōs in rāmīs 
cōnsīdentēs. Flagrum arripiō (id erat in cymbā), item illicō 
virgam dēcīdō. Concitātiōre flagrī verbere psittacum assequor, 
hāmōque dēprehendō. Rōstrum ejus metuēns, sarmentō oculōs meōs 
prōtegēbam. Ille autem subitō dolōre territus, prōrsus exuit 
fortitūdinem, neque valdē reluctābātur. Itaque sarmentō, quod in 
laevā tenēbam, caput ejus opprimō, mox pede inculcō sarmentum, 
expedītōque cultellō ūnam plūmam circumcīdō. Nē longus sim, 
fūniculō attentum dēvehō domum, asperiōre captūrā nihil gravius 
perpessum. Fūne pede dēligō, perticā ad īnsidendum datā. 
Facilius id vidēbātur, quam caveam ē cancellīs facere. 

137. Ego autem captīvīs leporibus cōnsulēns, dōlium quoddam ē 
perfrāctīs trānsennā īnstrūxeram: hīc in cavō rūpis dēgēbant. 
Fīmus caprīnus, quem ē stabulō ēgererem, in sicciōre humō 
appositus, locōs praeparābat in quibus caespitēs herbāsque 
leporibus dīlēctās dēfoderem. Leporēs summā cūrā pāscō ac 
mānsuēfaciō. 

138. Sed in nārrātiōne meā paulum nunc regredī opus est. Ut mē 
oblectārem, saepius librum sūmēbam; aliās mathēmaticum illum, 
quī teneram cūram prīmī meī atque optimī patrōnī revocābat; 
aliās geōgraphicum. Hinc quōdam diē dē Indīs ēdiscō, quam 
prūdenter ferōs elephantōs mānsuēfaciant. Equidem dē caprīs meīs 
ad trahulam jungendīs cōgitāveram, sed nōndum grandēs erant: 
hārum autem opperīrī aetātem, longum vidēbātur. Jam, hīs 
perlēctīs, crēdidī, posse caprum ferum pariter ac ferum 
elephantum ad quamlibet aptārī disciplīnam, cujus quidem ⸤ipsīus 
nātūra⸥ foret capāx: cūncta in eō vertī, ut feram in manū 
tenērēs. 139. Rē ponderātā, dēmum ēgressus sum, certus 
dēpugnandī. Duās succingor pistolās, quibus mē in extrēmīs 
prōtegam; sed restibus laqueīsque sum frētus. Laqueīs duōbus 
tribulōs ferreōs, sī rēctē rem nōminō, validissimē annexueram. 
Tribulī autem tālī erant nātūrā, ut, hominis pede oppressī, 
trīna spīcula in solō dēfīgerent. In rēticula herbās comportābam 
eās quās maximē dēligēbant caprī. Canem domī cōnstringō, atque 
sīc armātus sēdēs petō caprīnās. Plūrēs ibi videō caprās atque 
haedōs; mox caprum quendam grandem ac rōbustum contemplor, (vix 
minor erat quam bonus asinus) quī vīribus cōnfīsus seorsum 
agēbat. Hunc adeō, herbās suāvissimās porrigēns. 140. Ille autem 
neque territus neque īrātus, accēdit rōditque libenter. Herbās 
in humum prōjiciō, dumque pāscitur, laqueōs cum tribulīs super 
cornibus impōnō. Tribulum ūnum pede pressum humī īnfīgō; dein, 
antequam sentiat, inculcō alterum quoque, et sub pede attineō. 
Prōtinus gnārus sē illigātum, in posteriōribus crūribus sē 
ērigit, sūrsum capite nītēns: ego autem tertiō laqueō pedēs ejus 
prīmōrēs involvō. In eō erat ut alterum extraheret tribulum, 
quandō artē cōnstrictīs prīmōribus pedibus, quōs in āere 
habēbat, ego asperrimē trūdēns dējiciō eum in latus. Cōnsīdō in 
armum, inculcāns cornū. Ille autem sīc dēpressō capite 
pedibusque correptīs, onus violentissimē dētrectābat, sed 
nequībat excutere. Ego nōn invītus sinō eum sē dēfatīgāre 
calcitrantem, sūbulamque[N] grandem ac lōrum expediō. 141. Summā 
in tranquillitāte labrum ejus superius perfodiō, atque īnserō 
lōrum, quod ānulī īnstar concinnō, plūriēs nōdātum. Tribulīs 
novō in locō dēfīxīs, amplius paulō lībertātis pedibus ejus 
permittō, ut amplius sē dēfatīget frūstrā connītendō. Tandem 
dēfessus, sūdōre perfūsus, requiēscit. Herbīs in reticulum 
recollēctīs, surgō; convellō tribulōs, appendōque cervīcī ejus; 
tum labrō trahō lēniter. Is, dolōre gemēns, ērēxit sē, 
invītusque sequēbātur, pedibus etiamnum cōnstrictīs, sed nōn 
adductē. 142. Sīc quīnquāgintā forsitan passūs eum dēdūxī. Tum 
subitō reluctābātur; sed dolōre labrī percitus, cornū mē 
feriēbat: id vērō facile caveō, lōrō subtrahēns; simul, iterum 
adductō laqueō, praepediō crūra. Sānē ille tōtus contremīscere, 
praeteritōrum memor et posthāc mē sequitur oboedientissimē: quod 
simul atque animadvertō, porrigō herbās ante nārēs. Nōlēbat 
rōdere, sed odōrem libēns captābat; jamque facile eum in saltum 
meum dēdūcō. Ibi arborī firmiter alligātum famē parō expugnāre. 
Porrō id nūllīus erat labōris; etenim postquam haedōs jūxtā 
affīxeram, mixtā crūdēlitāte et clēmentiā mox plēnissimē est 
domitus. 

143. Explōrātō, posse feram sīc subigī, post aliquot diēs capram 
pariter aggressus, hanc quoque vel facilius dēdūxī. Duo haedī 
grandēs ac paene adultae mātrem ad praesaepe volentēs secūtae 
sunt; tum novā veterī admixtā catervā cito maerēre dēstitit. 
Itaque grex meus jam caprum habēbat ac capram, item trēs haedōs 
duāsque juvencās caprās. Ego vērō cūnctōs incipiō trahulā 
cōnsuēfacere. Difficile sānē est rēs gestās ōrdine statō 
nārrāre. Quippe perpetuō variābantur labōrēs meī, neque umquam 
ūnō quasi nīsū ūllum opus perfēcī, sed particulātim operābar, 
seu tempestāte caelī mōtus, seu phantasiā, vel subitō aliquid 
recordāns; et sīquid parum bene valēre crēderem, reficiēbam in 
melius. Dē piscātiōne meā mox sum dictūrus. Sīc, inter labōrēs 
multōs et ōtiī paulum, praeteriēre mēnsēs. 

144. Circā Kalendās Aprīlēs, ut crēdō, imber mātūtīnus (dē quō 
memorāvī) largior et almior cecidit. Mīrum inde vigōrem nacta 
sunt omnia quae gignit humus, mīramque ego ipse voluptātem 
percēpī. Exspatiandum dēcernō. Ad speculam meam (dē quā ante 
memorāvī) ēnīsus, prōgredior ut lītus ad Orientem amplius 
cognōscerem. Duo mīllia fortasse passūs prōcesseram, quum viam 
quandam Lūnātam videō (sī sīc licet appellāre), quae flexū 
continuō, acclīvitāte modicā, ab ōrā maris palmārum ferācī ad 
culmen hujusce regiōnis dūcēbat. Jam praeter ōram maritimam duo 
numerābam prōmontoria duōsque sinūs: nunc Tertium hunc appellō 
sinum. 145. Cēterīs in rēbus prīmō nihil novī exhibēbātur, nisi 
quod arēnae extendēbantur lātissimae. Plūribus hās rēbus 
distīnctās vidēbam. Expedītō prōspeculō, marīnās dispiciō 
testās,—immō testūdinēs,—dīversissimās magnitūdine. Id quidem 
gaudeō. Porrō hōc in sinū palmae ita dominābantur, ut vix 
quidquam aliud inter arborēs dēsuper vīderim. Palūdēs autem 
longiōrēs in rūpibus continuābantur suprā palmās illās. Ut 
explōrem cūncta propius, palūde quādam nōn facile circuitā, 
dēscendō ad ōram maris. Tria palmārum genera agnōscō, flectō 
sēnsim ad sinistram, dēmum Lūnātā illā viā domum redeō. 146. 
Posteā mēcum excutiēns, cūr in portū meō cactī optimē 
crēscerent, palmārum nihil esset; colligō, quia palūdēs apud mē 
super rūpibus nōn sint, idcircō neque cocōs neque aliās palmās 
nāscī. 147. Jam dē grege quotīdiāna mē incessit cūra, ignārum 
quid sānitātī necessārium foret, et quantus ac quālis hujus 
aestātis calor. Multa fēcī, mox īnfecta reddidī; quae nārrāre 
nōn opus est. In saltū meō novum praesaepe meditābar. Sed haedōs 
nōn effugitūrōs crēdō, retentīs caprō caprāque; igitur solvō. 
Canis autem tunc mēcum erat, ipsum ad saltum. Is, simul ut haedī 
excurrere in prāta coepērunt, novā lībertāte gestientēs, ipse 
lūdī fit particeps: quippe collūsōrem diū nōn habuerat. Tum mihi 
aspectus sānē erat jūcundissimus. 148. Caper, immō capra, ut 
crēdō, brevī in curriculō plērōsque canēs vēnāticōs superat, sed 
canī perdūrat vēlōcitās. Ipsae sē haedī tam pernīcēs 
ostendēbant, ut nōn sine magnā contentiōne canis eās 
praeverterit. Neque volēbant effugere; nam iterum iterumque 
redībant. Ego vērō omnium hilaritāte exhilarātus, increpō mēmet, 
quod cicurēs animantēs tam innocentī voluptāte prīvāverim. 

149. Caprōs hōs dictitō; attamen nēquāquam erant nostrātium 
caprōrum ad normam. Antilopās equīnōs vel ὄρυγας fortasse quis 
illōs appellāverit. Cervīx hōrum carnōsa et arcuāta, armus 
amplus plānusque, equum generōsum referēbat. Pellis brevissimō 
dēlicātissimōque villō sīve lānūgine, colōre mustēlīnō, 
vestiēbātur; neque saeta inerat neque pilus, praeterquam in jubā 
atque in maris barbā. Juba ferē tōta in ipsō sēdit armō. 
Lacertōsiōrēs erant quam dāmae fulvae; ferō potius cervō 
comparāverim. Cētera erant rotunda, bene compācta; crūra autem 
gracilia, ex osse dēnsissimō. Os frontis valdē rōbustum crēdidī. 
Cornua nōn recurva, sed propiōra taurīnīs; id quod arcuātae 
cervīcī crēdēbam aptius. Caprae cornua divergēbant aliquantum. 
150. Antehāc cūnctōs in trahulā exercueram, sed sine pondere: 
pondus nūdō dorsō saepius impōnēbam: nunc caprō capraeque 
quotīdiānum labōrem adjūdicō, sī rēctē possim apparāre. 
Retinācula fūnālia trahulae adaptāveram, sed collāre tractōrium 
longē erat difficilius. Quidquid compēgeram, rudius esse sēnsī: 
id enim erat agendum, ut nē pulmōnem onus opprimeret. Vīdī tamen 
armōs cervīcemque equīnīs esse tam compariā, ut sī male rēs 
cessisset, artifex culpandus foret, nōn animal. Nihilōminus 
totiēs male rem gessī, ut dēstiterim amplius hāc in viā cōnārī. 
Fūnēs dēmum meōs circum frontem, cornibus sustentātōs, composuī; 
id quod sī nōn optimē, at satis bene cōnfēcit rem. 

151. Ligna quae superne ad rūpis marginem convēxī, ⸤ut plūrimum⸥ 
dēvolvō, trahulā suprā relictā. Ferē quotīdiē post fīnītum 
imbrem haedōs cum cane submittō in clīvīs lūsūrōs. Valdē mihi 
placēbat, quod canis circumcurrere et circumscrībere eās, 
pāstōrīciī canis mōre, magis in diēs discēbat. Ego autem, sī 
longiusculē abesse vidērentur, jubēbam: “īret, redūceret:” quod 
quidem ille, quasi probē intellegēns, cōnfestim faciēbat. Porrō 
grex ipse canem dīligere vidēbātur. Jam spērābam nōn necesse 
fore ut hās vincīrem, quae ferae lībertātis nōn recordārentur. 
152. Aliud quoque mox excōgitāvī. Ex virgulā quādam, puerōrum 
nostrōrum mōre, cavātā ac terebrātā, fistulam cōnfēcī. Hāc clārē 
canēbam quotiēs gregem eram pāstūrus: immō, sī in viā inter 
trahendum caprō forem vēscendī factūrus cōpiam, fistulā anteā 
sēdulō sonābam; neque umquam eōs frūstrābar, sed post illum 
cantum, aut cibātum illīs aut pōtum fidēlissimē afferēbam. Inde 
factum est, ut sonō fistulae libentissimē accurrerent. 153. Dē 
cibō meō restat aliquid nārrandum. Pānem nauticum ac farīnam ē 
nāve eō magis cōnsūmēbam, quia verēbar nē mūcēscerent. Videō 
autem, sī Summī Nūminis dēcrētō hīc diūtius mihi sit dēgendum, 
domesticīs opus esse cōpiīs. Quidquid herbārum, arōmatis, 
frūctuumve condiat cibōs, sī nec ponderōsum sit et cōnservārī 
queat, id fateor ā longinquō nōn male importārī: sed quidquid 
sit quō vēscar praesertim, hoc omne sub meā esse manū oportēre 
crēdō. Igitur agellum vel angulum potius in portū dioscōreīs 
dēstināveram, sī humum idōneam afferre possem. Siccātae carnis 
paululum restābat, neque id jūcundum. Leporem, praeter prīmum 
illud ā cane, nōn gustāveram; sed piscēs facile capiō,—id quod 
explicandum est. 154. Prīmō līneā hāmīs īnstrūctā piscābar, sed 
hujus valdē taedēbat mē. Posteā pōne cymbam parvum verriculum 
trahēbam, quod identidem scrūtābar, plūrēsque hōc modō piscēs 
capiēbam. Mox alia succurrit ratiō,—ut ōstium portūs verriculīs 
trājicerem; idque fēcī, quamvīs difficile erat valida ferrāmenta 
in scopulōs illōs (Postēs quōs dīxī) īnfīgere. Clāvōs spīcātōs ē 
ferrō optimō postquam satis acuī, malleō artillātōris sīc 
impēgī, ut angustās rīmās inter saxa exsculperem: hūc adēgī 
ferrāmenta, quibus rētia innīterentur. 155. Aestus alluēbat 
piscēs, quōrum aliquot saltem numquam nōn relinquēbantur in 
verriculīs. Interdum magna vīs capiēbātur; tunc maritimae avēs 
per rētia irruentēs mēque et praedam meam vexābant. Quoniam 
⸤corticibus sublāta⸥ natārent verricula, piscēs attinēbantur sub 
aquā, quae profunda erat in ōstiō. Itaque hoc meum aestimō esse 
vīvārium, unde piscēs, quotiēs velim, nōn magnō labōre capiō. 
Magnum mihi labōrem attulerant verricula; sed animum meum, dē 
cibātū canis fēliumque ānxium, sōlābantur. 

156. Profectō quandō dē meīs labōribus mēcum reputō, illa mihi 
interdum subit animum contemplātiō, anne, sī optimus parēns, ut 
erat tenerrimus, sīc sagāx fuisset meaeque intellegēns indolis, 
posset forsan mē domī apud sē tenēre, contentum atque beātum. 
Nae, sī probē mē nōsset, nōn in Anglicārum lēgum studia,—semper 
ārida, jejūna, saepissimē praeposterā,—incumbere mē voluisset; 
sed impigrum ac strēnuum aliquod opus, ubi oculus manusque 
viget, tālī commendāsset fīliō. Poteram autem patriae lītora vel 
agrum lātius pervagārī, parentibus nōn dērelictīs. Etenim 
meminī, quandō eram in Brazīliā, quamdiū nova erat opera, mīrā 
mē vehementiā eam semper persecūtum esse. Nempe ut fortis equus 
īre vult, sed quōrsum aut quārē, nescit; sīc impetū quōdam ad 
agendum īnstīgābar, nūllō satis certō āctiōnis fīne prōpositō: 
itaque, rem quampiam assecūtus, simul fastīdiēbam. Nec ūlla 
profundior causa in fūnestam illam et scelerātam nāvigātiōnem mē 
prōpulit, ex quā in exilium trīstissimum et labōriōsissimum sum 
dētrūsus. 



CAPUT (VII.) SEPTIMUM. 


157. Dē capiendīs piscibus memorāvī: dē coquinandīs addō pauca. 
Octo decemve piscēs, vel pauciōrēs sī grandēs erant, rapidō igne 
leviter ēlixābam, tum pinnās,—id est, tōta latera,—capita, 
caudās, fēlibus meīs reservābam. Magnā spīnā extractā, cēteram 
carnem aut super crāticulā leviter torrēbam, aut cum fabīs vel 
grānō admiscēbam prō canis cibātū. Equidem in verriculō saepius 
marīna animālia inveniēbam, quālia nēmō piscēs nōmināverit: 
porrō piscium genus valdē carnōsum, quod magnī aestimābam, 
squātinīs nostrīs simillimum. Illud addō: sī vellem, poteram 
facillimē grallātōriās avēs quae inter cautēs aut ipsō in portū 
piscābantur, igne dējectās capere: sed carnem piscōsam fore 
crēdidī, pulveris nitrātī dispendiō male ēmptam. 

158. Farīnā autem ēlixā cum piscibus vēscēbar prīmō; mox Arabum 
mōre assās placentās faciēbam. Nempe, combustīs super ferreā 
lāminā vel plānō saxō lignīs, prūnās submovēbam; placentās ūdās 
in calidā superficiē positās sub patellā ferreā obtegēbam: huic 
iterum superingerēbam prūnās. Placentae subter, velut in furnō, 
coquēbantur: sed fermentāre placentās nesciēbam. 159. Dē hīs 
hāctenus. Cēterum dē pulchritūdine rērum quae domicilium meum 
cingēbant, nōn eram incūriōsus. In flōribus aut foliīs sī quid 
excelleret, plūriēs reportāvī aut rādīcem aut sarmentum, quod 
dēfoderem in cavernārum vīcīniā. Summā in aestāte cocī nucem, 
quae suā ex arbore dēciderat, reportāvī mēcum, plēnē mātūram 
crēdēns; mox ipsō in portū meō serendam dēcrēvī. Etenim sīc 
commentābar mēcum: “sī properē in Angliam āvehar, numquam mē 
paenitēbit hanc sēvisse arborem, plūrium fortasse parentem, 
aliōrum hominum domicilium ōrnātūram: sīn hāc in īnsulā dētinear 
ultrā biennium, gaudēbō arbusculam vidēns surgentem.” Sēdulō 
dēlēgī locum serendī, congessīque humum ūberrimam; statuō 
irrigandam esse dīligentissimē. 160. Post diem sānē labōriōsum, 
dum sub astrīs vēscor et bibō, antequam mē in aquārum lavācrum 
committam, mīror quamnam ob rem mē tantopere fatīgem. “Anne, Ō 
fatue Rebilī, nihil tibi esse operis putās? Timēsne, nē facile 
nimis vīvēns, socordiā opprimāris?” Tum respondeō: (etenim mōris 
meī erat, multa clārē loquī. Nisi hoc fēcissem, patriae linguae 
forem oblītus: immō ipsum mentis acūmen hebetātum foret. Sed 
prope omnia mea difficiliōra cōnsilia, plēnā ōrātiōne 
prōnūntiandō, dēfīniēbam magis et cōnsummābam.) Itaque 
respondeō: “Cibus, vestis, domicilium, vītam asservant hominis; 
sed pulchritūdō beātam facit vītam. Ad portum meum adōrnandum, 
in honōrem ejus et pulchritūdinem, cocum nucem cēterāsque rēs 
cōnsēvī.” Extemplō etiam clārius, “Ōh fatue Rebilī! (inquam) 
hominum neutiquam miserrimus es tū, quī adōrnandō domiciliō dās 
operam.” 

161. Aliam rem, absurdum forsitan, nōn absurdum erit lēctōrī 
commūnicāre. Quārtō diē postquam cocum īnsēvī, longius dūrante 
pluviā, tempus computābam, inveniōque nātālī mātris diē mē illam 
sēvisse nucem. Mox meminī, quam incertum sit, vīvatne māter an 
mortua sit. Mīrē tangēbar et tenerā perfundēbar memoriā. Tum 
quia plūrēs nōveram vel audīveram, quī praesāgium mortis 
alicujus sē habuisse crēderent, hoc mihi ipsī mātris mortem 
ōminārī vidēbātur. Etenim jam fassus sum, mē, simul ac opere 
cessārem, maestum saepius ēvāsisse frāctumque animō. 162. Quandō 
mē ineptiārum incūsō, respondeō, “fortasse nōn esse ineptum.” 
Nam sī restituat mē Deus in patriam, tum aut gaudēbō vīvam 
inveniēns mātrem, aut rēctissimē praecēperō dēbitam maestitiam. 
Sīn numquam restituar, sed sōlitārius peream, minus sum 
inhūmānus, minus ab omnibus necessitūdinibus abruptus, quandō 
cāritāte praeteritōrum ēmollior. Melius autumō, propter ficta 
hūmānārum rērum flēre, quam rēbus hūmānīs omnīnō nōn tangī, et 
prō mē sōlō vīvere. 163. Quamobrem ubi nōna venit diēs, dēcernō 
in honōrem mātris novemdiālem praebēre cēnam. Hospitēs autem, 
quōs sōlōs potuī invītāre, erant psittacus, canis, grex, 
leporēs, fēlēs, columbī. Hīs optimam, quantum possim, parō 
cēnam. Cēterōs facile satiō, sed duās capellārum experior 
avidissimās. Magnitūdine in diēs crēscēbant. Omnēs, cibō 
succulentō pāstōs, spērābam majōrēs pinguiōrēsque quam fera 
animālia fore, sī semper largiter praebērem. Etenim vēlōcitātem 
in caprīs minimē cupiēbam. Pondus corporis trahulae conveniēbat 
vel lac prōmittēbat ūberius; itaque largā manū pāscēbam libēns. 
In pābulō autem erat grāmen merum, frondēs item herbae plūrēs 
dēlicātae, quās in mātris honōrem suggesseram. Hās cūnctās 
comedunt, concupīscuntque etiam. Imber dēstiterat commodē: 
cēnseō igitur fīniendam in saltū novemdiālem cēnam. 164. Quam 
celerrimē ānulō lōreō caprum apparō, ejusque caudae capram 
adjungō: cēterōs solvō. Falcātum gladium in balteum īnserō, 
caprumque dūcēns nōtum ascendō trāmitem. Illī sequuntur. Canis 
in fronte excurrit, psittacus humerō meō īnsēderat, suō mōre 
garriēns incontinenter. Fēlēs ⸤mīrābundae ēmigrātiōnem⸥ ejulant, 
tamquam plōrātrīcēs (opīnābar) ad sepulcrum, mox nōlēbant 
prōgredī: cum leporibus domī remanēbant. Magnam vēlī laciniam 
cum fūniculīs in dorsum caprī conjēceram; sīc saltum attinēmus. 
Haedī alternīs pāscuntur, lūdunt. Sed ego gladiō falcātō herbās 
frondēsque mollēs, quae sub quotīdiānā pluviā luxuriābant, 
largiter succīdō,—aliās laciniā vēlī obvolvō, aliās merō fūne 
colligō,—super dorsō jūmentōrum appōnēns. Opportūnum erat, quod 
tunc haec pābula dēportāvī, nam posteā propter pluviās paulō 
difficilior fuit convectiō. Cēterum animantium hilaritās et mea 
ipsīus excitātiō maestitiam mihi dispulit. 

165. Sub longiōre pluviā multum ego cum psittacō loquēbar; quod 
quidem ab initiō fēceram. Sed postquam cōnsuētus est nucēs atque 
aliōs cibōs ē manū meā capere, gaudēbatque meō adventū, properē 
discēbat loquī, et valdē mē rīsū alloquiōque sōlābātur. Etenim, 
ut plūrimum, docēbam eum sīc prōnūntiāre: “Ō fatue Rebilī!” sīc 
enim mēmet appellāre solēbam. Atquī ille vocābulum “fatue” aut 
nōn potuit dīcere aut nōn voluit, meum autem nōmen libentissimē 
ac plēnissimē prōferēbat. 166. Aliquandō audiēbam, Ō debilī 
Rebilī; vel, Ō febilī Rebilī; aliās, Ō hebilī Rebilī; quae 
quidem sīc interpretābar, ut essent, Ō dēbilis, Ō flēbilis, Ō 
habilis! dubitābamque subrīdēns, numne habilis magis an dēbilis 
essem. Sed longē saepius meum nōmen ipsum iterābat, et quasi 
variābat amātōriē. Ō Rebilī Rebilī, inquiēbat; tum accelerāns 
semper sonōrum cursum, Ō Rebī bilī, Rebī rebī, Rebī relilī, Rebī 
libilī, Ō!—Et quum ego trīstī cum misericordiā vocābulum Ō! 
prōnūntiārem, ille mē imitāns prīmō tragicā sevēritāte dīcēbat 
Ō! sed in fīne tamquam cavillāns dērīdēnsque illud Ō! 
joculāriter efferēbat, dōnec in cachinnōs solvor.—Neque vincīre 
eum opus erat; itaque ligāmina dētrāxī. 

167. Omnium ūvidissimus, ut opīnor, Jūnius erat mēnsis, numquam 
tamen quīnque vel sex hōrās exsuperābant pluviae. Quōdam diē 
post imbrem splendida fuit caelī serēnitās cum aurā mollissimā. 
Interrogāvī mēmet, quidnam facere oportēret. Statim respondī,—
“Nunc, sī vir es, Rebilī! testūdinem marīnam reportābis.” Hoc 
namque saepe cupīveram, cōnātus eram numquam; sed hāc in 
⸤clāritāte sōlis⸥ post pluviam, testūdinēs crēdēbam summā in 
aquā suspēnsum īrī. 168. Cymbā expedītā prōgressus sum. Lātō 
lēnīque mōtū fluctuābat aequor maris, molle, rūgōsum, et quasi 
oleō perfūsum. Fervōrem sōlis aura marīna discutiēbat: itaque 
pergō. Tertium illum attingō sinum; mox videō testūdinēs 
plūrimās, summīs in aquīs aprīcantēs, fortasse dormītantēs. 
Cautissimē circumspiciō, et modicā dēligō[O] magnitūdine ūnam, 
cujus caput erat āversum. 169. Lēnissimō mōtū allābor, omnēsque 
caveō strepitūs; dein pedēs testūdinis posteriōrēs trānsversīs 
manibus arripiēns, dum ad prōram genibus innītor, ūnō mōlīmine 
ac jactū praedam mediā in cymbā teneō supīnam. Morsus testūdinis 
horrendus est: hunc sī cavēbis, cētera erunt in facilī: in 
dorsum autem conjecta, jacet immōbilis. Cōnfestim redeō, tam 
citō successū laetus. Postmodo haec praeda majōris mihi erat 
quam putāveram. 

170. In diēs mox foedior ingruēbat tempestās. Tandem inter 
nimbōs nigerrimōs prōdībant fulgura tremenda, quae frīgus 
maximum incutiēbant: grandinis procellae sequēbantur. Tonitrua 
per plūrēs hōrās erant paene continua. Mare vehementer furēbat; 
aestus ipsās ad rūpēs pertigit. Quandō pluvia paulisper 
dēstitit, exeō prōspectūrus: ecce autem carīna nāvis nostrae 
decem mēnsibus post naufragium, ipsīs in arēnīs intrā cautēs 
prōjecta. 171. Extrā cautēs mare montōsum erat; intrā tam 
perfrāctum, ut nūlla posset esse cymbae ūtilitās: sed valdē 
brevem esse intellegō aquam. Tantā sum cupiditāte incēnsus, ut 
caligīs ac bracchiīs exūtīs, mare ingressus nāvis fragmina 
scānserim. Summae sānē partis nōn multum restābat: quid 
remanēret in alveō, volō inquīrere. Facile videō et multa inesse 
et nihil posse mē id temporis āmōlīrī: itaque postquam satis 
explōrāvī, redeō domum, per aquās praeter rūpēs necessāriō 
vādēns. 172. Sed algēbam, crepitābantque dentēs meī. Mūtō 
vestīmenta: fricō cutem: sed algeō tamen. Ignem accendō, neque 
inde multum acquīrō calōris. Sēnsim invēnī, penitus in vīscera 
dēscendisse frīgus, et morbō mē pertentārī. Prōjectus in cubīlī, 
quidquid ibi erat vestīmentōrum circumvolvor. Nēquicquam. 
Ignārus quid facere oporteat, pavēscō nē vesper ingruat, 
tenebrīs obtegar, inops auxiliī cōnsiliīque. Tandem algōribus 
meīs nimius fervor succēdēbat, valdē profectō violentus. 173. 
Interdum Maurōrum fōrmulam adhibēns, in pectore aspīrāvī: “Ō 
Deus! ā tē prōdīvī, ad tē redeam!” Quid foret, esse sōlitārium, 
tum dēmum cognōveram. Jacēre, stāre, sedēre, cūncta dolēbant; 
flagrābat caput. Corporis dolōrēs angor mentis exsuperābat. 
Tenebrās, omnium rērum maximē, metuēbam. Surgō, pede titubante 
incēdō, aquam pōtulentam et citrea māla quaerēns. Ōs interius 
plānē siccum erat; lingua sī buccās, sī palātum tangeret, ibi 
adhaerēbat. Quārē mālum citreum in tenuissimās quasi assulās 
concīdī, quārum ūnam linguae apposuī: aliās in pōculō compressī, 
deinde aquā commiscuī. Hoc medicāmentum sorbillābam, interdum 
bibēbam. Crēdidī fervōrī vīscerum id fore ūtile. Alteram mox 
atque alteram super linguam compōnō assulam citricam, siccitātis 
levāmentum. Jam nox adveniēbat, recordorque animālia nōn esse 
pāsta. Fēlēs vehementer ejulābant. Neque potuī eās abigere, 
neque, dum fervor capitis īnstat, sufficiunt mihi vīrēs ad 
ministrandum. 

174. Tandem in sūdōrem solvor: post hōrās dolentissimās mēns sē 
aliquantum recuperat. Spissō obvolūtus palliō, cibātum praebeō 
fēlibus, leporibus, caprīs, canī, quamquam dēbilis tōtō corpore. 
Jam certum habeō, quālis sit febris hujus nātūra; fēlīcemque mē 
jūdicō, quod lūx in tantum dūrāverit. Mente levātus, plūrimīsque 
vestibus opertus, somnum captō; sed quandō dormītō paulisper, 
morbida mē terrent īnsomnia, prāvā religiōne plēnā. Sānē 
plūribus hōrīs ante lūcem ipse sūdor cessat; tum, quamvīs 
dēfessus, labōriōsē cutem perfricō, et quidquid ē vestīmentīs 
maximē sit villōsum, libēns amplector: ligna in culīnā accendō. 
Dē remediō morbī tum meditor. Dīxī mē cinchōnam ē valle 
apportāsse, atque in ūsum coriī adhibuisse. Bonam hinc esse 
medicīnam nōveram; nunc vērō contrā amāritūdinem ejus firmāns 
mentem, aquā commixtam līberē pōtō. Nec dubitō quīn mē sagāciter 
cūrāverim; nam febris nōn rediit. Māne autem ē cubīlī surgēns, 
cōgitō quid posteā faciendum. 

175. Imprīmīs statuō: sī possim, noctem īnsequentem nōn sine 
lūmine mē āctūrum. Aut candēlās aut lucernam aliquam jūdicō 
necessāriam. Nihil facilius vidēbātur, quam Maurōrum rītū rem 
cōnficere, sī aut oleum aut sēbum habērem. Sed quicquid fuit, id 
omne crēdidī cōnsūmptum esse, aut in cibātū canis aut in scaphā 
resarciendā, sīve in retināculīs jūmentōrum vel in serrā. Tum 
testūdinis reminīscor: hujus adipem volō adhibēre. Item carnem 
ejus, ut novum quiddam, prō cibō statim concupīscō. Dē mactandā, 
fateor, haesitābam; nam tāle fēceram nihil. Caput testūdinis sī 
amputābitur, tamen (ajunt) post vīgintī quattuor hōrās mordēbit 
tenācissimē. Quid ergō occīdet eam? Ego vērō opīnor, amputātō 
capite, nihil dolōris sēnsūrum corpus. Igitur ipsō in dōliō, ubi 
in aquā marīnā servābātur, amputō caput: hoc cautē forcipe 
abjiciō: cētera concīdō et plūrima intus ōva inveniō. Hōrum 
quattuor prōtinus torreō, vēscorque cum placentā. Maximam vim 
adipis excipiō. Partem hujus (eam ferē quae solidior erat) prō 
placentīs assandīs vel prō sartāgine reservāvī: longē plūrimam 
prō oleō sūmpsī. Tum dē līnāmentīs cōgitō. 176. Fēlīciter 
accidit, quod huic reī nōn opus est vīribus: līnāmenta 
contorquēre, puellārum potest esse opera. Veterum fūnium 
quidquid esset corruptum, prō stuppā reposueram. Inde duābus 
hōrīs līnāmenta cōnfēcī, quot trīgintā noctibus facile 
sufficerent. In ferreā patellā dēpōnō adipem ac līnāmentum sīc 
circumtortum, ut fīnis hujus super labrō patellae minimum tantum 
dēpendat. Ipsum līnāmentum liquidā adipe saturātum accendō, 
experiorque rem bene prōcēdere. Equidem sī dormīrem, nēmine 
līnāmentum subinde extrahente, post paulō extīnctum foret: 
attamen id parum rēferre cēnseō; nam per igniāria possem 
accendere, ut prīmum ēvigilārem. Posteā juvat mē invēnisse, 
tālem febrem posse subigī. 

177. Post trīduum fīnītae sunt pluviae, et sōl prōcessit 
clārissimus. Ego quoque prōdeō, tepōre gaudēns. Invīsō lītus. 
Videō dōliīs strātum, cadīs, arcīs perfrāctīs, lignīs omnis 
fōrmae et ferrāmentīs. Paene in siccō erat ipse nāvis alveus, 
cum ancorā atque ancorālī. Cūncta jam prō meīs dēstinō, sed volō 
relaxārī paulisper; etenim minus firmum mē sēnsī: igitur ab hīs 
redeō in portum. 178. Fēlēs videō, utramque cum catulīs recēns 
nātīs. Tum mē subit: “Āh! illud erat, quārē adeō ejulāvēre; nōn 
tamquam fūneris plōrātrīcēs, sed ut expostulārent catulōrum 
alimenta.” Bonīs mātribus collaudātīs, praetereō. Jamque 
recordor, feram fēlem prīmō illō diē esse ā mē vīsam; dē quō 
posteā aliquotiēs dubitāveram. Agnōscō, aut in saltū aut in 
silvā magnā tālēs invenīrī bēstiās. 179. Gregem dēambulāns 
assequor. Haedōs omnēs grandēscere ac pinguēscere notāveram; 
jamque videō jūniōrēs capellās spem prōlis dare. Invīsō leporēs: 
ēn autem, lepus fēmina lepusculōs ēdiderat. Nōn rīdēre nōn 
poteram: immō cachinnāvī. Sīc autem interpretātus sum: Teneram 
prōgeniem male nāscī ante fīnītās pluviās: quārē sīc esse ā 
Nātūrā comparātum, ut quam proximē posteā nāscerentur. 

180. Lēctōrī dēnūntiandum est, inde ab illā febre pietātis mē 
cōnscium novae factum. Rē nōn prōrsus nova erat; nam inde ab 
ipsō naufragiō quasi fermentātiō mentis coepta est. Tum prīmum 
didicī, quantī esset hūmāna cāritās, quam jūcundus ipse aspectus 
hominis. Mox ergā ipsa animālia ēmolliēbar, quōrum cāritātem 
plūris quam ūtilitātēs aestimābam. Deinde intellēxī, quam ingēns 
esset inter generōsissimum brūtōrum atque īnfimum hominem 
discrīmen: etenim quemvīs ē servīs meīs Brazīlicīs locō canis 
optimī vehementissimē amplexus forem. 181. Jam paenitēbat mē dē 
parentibus: nēminem praeter mēmet culpābam. Ergā hōs reverentia, 
ergā omnēs impetus quīdam amōris ac dēsīderiī mē exercēbat: 
itaque, ut opīnor, ad rēctam religiōnem eram mātūrus. Etenim 
dīxit nesciō quis: “Quī īnferiōra bene amat, hic superiōrem bene 
venerābitur.” Attamen ante hanc febrem ipse Deus ignōtus quīdam 
ac nimius vidēbātur mihi; quem quidem dīligere, praeter nātūram 
esse cēnsēbam. Nec hīs dē rēbus singillātim juvat explicāre. 
Quippe neque ego ab aliīs neque cēterī ā mē eam religiōnem 
ēdiscent, quae pectoris est, nōn merae mentis. 182. Sed ipsā in 
febre, quandō tranquillē Deō mē commīsī, intellēxī prīmum, quam 
nōn longinquus esset Deus; immō, ipsō illō in locō adesse illum, 
sī uspiam alibī. Exinde profundior dē religiōne mē invādēbat 
cōgitātiō; neque cōgitātiō sōlum, sed cordis quīdam mōtus, quī 
mē tunc prīmum ad sacram lēctiōnem īnstīgābat. 

183. Ē quattuor meīs librīs, ūnum dīxī esse precum Lūsitānārum 
secundum fōrmās Papālēs. Idcircō sprēveram. Nunc autem legēns, 
plūrēs inveniō versiculōs ē Jūdaicīs et Chrīstiānīs librīs, quī 
cūnctōrum sunt, nōn Papistārum modo. Duo mē praesertim 
commovēbant. “Quem dīligit Dominus Deus, hunc castīgat, per 
virgārum disciplīnam ērudiēns fīliōs.” Item. “Quārē homō, quī 
vēscitur aurā, dē poenīs dēlictōrum conquerātur? nae, prōdest in 
juventā sustinēre jugum.” 184. Tālī lēctiōne affectum, precēs et 
vērae et vehementēs sānctō mē gaudiō tum prīmum pertentārunt. 
Porrō hinc repperī, unde sōlitāriae vītae dērīvārem sōlātia. 
Inquiētissimus sānē interdum eram, pertaesus sōlitūdinis et 
suspīrāns ad alloquium; attamen tria tandem plēnē didicī:—
cōnstantius ea quae animō, quam ea quae oculō percipiuntur, 
permanēre:—Deum nōn minus mihi esse praesentem, quod abessent 
hominēs:—dēnique, Ut ex hōc taediō mē potuit ēripere, sīc in 
eōdem posse illum ⸤pūrgātō mihi animō⸥ plēniōrem dare 
līberātiōnem.—Sed haec pedetentim et plūrēs per mēnsēs. Quippe 
vēra religiō vīta est, nōn disceptātiō ingeniōsa, nec nisi multā 
pectoris exercitātiōne ipsārumque rērum experientiā percipitur. 



CAPUT (VIII.) OCTĀVUM. 


185. Dē grege erat quod mē male habēbat. Caprī maximī quamquam 
labrum perfōderam, tamen expertus sum aliquandō ferōciter eum 
cornibus petere; idque perīculōsum esse sēnsī, quandō ad 
trahulam eum vellem ligāre. Rē perpēnsā, nē mihi aliquandō sit 
īnfēstus, cornuum ejus maximam partem serrā amputō. Relinquō 
tantum, quantum helciīs sustentandīs sit opus. Exinde gnārus 
dēminūtārum vīrium, tranquillior factus est. 186. Nē posthāc 
oblīvīscar, hīc libet nārrāre, quidnam cornibus ejus fēcerim. 
Solidiōra erant, quam caprārum quae asservāveram: jam arcum 
terebrandī grātiā cōnficere statuō. Saxum quotiēs vellem 
perforāre, nihil ē meā supellectile placēbat. Erat mihi terebra,[
P] erat cestrum[Q] fabrīle, utrumque tenue nimis; nōn nisi lignō 
vel cornuī terebrandō idōneum. Ad saxum terebrandum clāvīs 
spīcātīs ūtēbar multō cum labōre; nunc arcum rītū Maurōrum libet 
adhibēre. 187. Imprīmīs ē vēlōrum fūniumque trochleolīs ūnam 
dēlēgī bonam, perfectō orbe, cujus in mediō quadrātum erat 
forāmen. Ferreolum item dēligō; (multa in lītore tālia tunc 
jacēbant) quae illud forāmen tantum[R] nōn intret. Hujus ūnum 
fīnem igne mollītum valdē tundō, ut sit et solidior et paene 
acūtus: alterum fīnem in teretius concinnō. Mox līmā hīc atque 
hīc dētrītam, in forāmen trochleolae impingō. Acūtiōrem fīnem 
molā quoque exacuō: sīc ipsam terebram perfēcī. 188. Arcus 
restat. Anquīsītō rōbore solidō, ūnum fragmentum circumcīdō 
serrā; dein duo forāmina paulō oblīqua terebrō, quōrum in 
utrumque īnferciātur cornū īnfimum. Spatium inter haec relinquō, 
velut manūbrium, quod firmiter possim prehendere: duōbus lāminīs 
ferreīs ac fūne rōbustō cōnfirmō jūnctūram: Cacūmina cornuum 
laxō nervō connectuntur: hic est arcus. 189. Nervus, trochleolae 
convolūtus trānsversusque, fit tēnsus: tum arcus, citrō ultrōque 
tractus, terebram rotat. Porrō in angustō axe forāmen faciō, 
quod alter terebrae fīnis facile intret. Axem hunc in dextrā 
tenēns, dīrigō terebram, dum sinistrā arcū operor. Simplicī hōc 
apparātū saxa dehinc longē facilius terebrō. 

190. Vereor nē taediō sim lēctōrī, sī plūrima quae ēlabōrāvī 
accūrātē explicem. Nova atque ampla māteriēs ē ferrō lignōque, 
quam cum reliquiīs nāvis nostrae nactus eram, novā mē implet 
ambitiōne: item auctus grex vim novam trahendī offert. Idcircō, 
plūrima convehenda dēstināns, majōrem volō cōnstruere traham, 
tam lātam, ut aequā fronte jūmenta trahant tria, mēque ipsum, 
quotiēs velim, habēnās retinentem, vehant. Quidquid lignō 
ferrōve cōnficiendum erat, cōnfēcī; sed corium dēerat. 191. 
Pellēs sī habērem, nec depsendī eram perītus, nec libēns propter 
pellēs caprōs occīderem. Tantum animal, tam plēnum sanguine, 
mactāre, āvehere, concīdere, nauseam mihi movēbat. 192. Sed ē 
fruticibus maritimīs ūnum repperī, cujus folia fūniculīs 
comparāverim. Haec in sōle siccāta, mox oleō tīncta, leviter 
contorsī, tum ex connexīs rōbustiōrēs strūxī fūnēs. Inde 
māteriem habēbam, ē quā habēnās, retinācula, etiam helcia atque 
aliās rēs jūmentīs ūtilēs cōnficiō. Hīs sī nōn optimē 
īnstruēbar, meīs tamen ūsibus fuēre idōneī. 

193. Vix opus est dīcere quam cūriōsē omnia ferrāmenta ex lītore 
collēgerim; nihil equidem sprēvī ē lignīs, dōliīs, arcīs, frācta 
an solida essent. Majōra quaedam ligna, multō mōlīmine sūrsum 
tracta ipsīs in calōribus, prō ponte dēstinō, per quem traha mea 
aquulam ē saltū trāmeet. Crātibus superjactīs et fiscōrum 
frustīs, cum tabulīs et humō, viam tandem cōnsolidāvī. 194. 
Alteram quoque viam sub rūpibus crēdō necessāriam, nē aestū 
maris interrumpātur trahae commeātus. Tornō meō (id est, novā 
terebrā) saxa cavō, nitrātō pulvere discutienda; et ⸤minus 
labōriōsē quam expectāveram⸥ objicēs āmoveō viae. Profectō hanc 
viam facilius cōnfēcī, quam ponticulum illum, quī quidem nōn 
magnō poterat esse ūsuī, dōnec trāmitem super rubrā rūpe fēceram 
trahae pervium. Omnium meōrum operum hoc vīrēs meās ūnicē 
exhausit, praesertim quia aurae tum maximē stāgnābant. Sed 
prōtinus magna habuī adjūmenta frūgibus vel frūctibus 
dēportandīs, sīve ab hortīs meīs sīve ā convalle. 

195. Quīntō diē ante Kalendās Sextīlēs, caprae duae partum 
ēdidērunt, ūnaquaeque bīnam prōgeniem. Prīmō lac mihimet avēbam, 
cōnorque mulgēre. Huic reī inhabilis fuī, reputānsque dēclīnō 
mulgendī labōrēs, nē ego potius pecorī quam pecus mihi 
īnserviat; nam sī mulgendī negligēns forem, id pecorī foret 
crūdēle, mox lactis cohibēret prōfluvium. Tum in dēlicātiōrēs 
cibōs lac adhibēre, longē nimiī temporis erat et cūrae. Spērō mē 
cocīs nucibus cito abundātūrum, atque hārum lac semper fore in 
prōmptū. Hīs autem dē nucibus sunt quaedam explicanda, quae 
praetermīseram. 196. Nōlueram barbarōrum mōre prōcērās arborēs 
scandere; id quod et labōriōsum fore et perīculōsissimum 
crēdidī. Novās scālās hanc ad rem, duōbus anteā mēnsibus, et 
propriam falculam commentātus sum. Et quidem prō falculā, 
⸤perticae longae in fīne⸥ loculum incīdō, ubi inhaereat ānsa 
cultrī coquīnāris: tum ⸤fūniculō cērā oblitō⸥ (nam massam 
quandam cērae habēbam) ānsam illam perticamque circumvolūtam 
firmiter cōnstrīnxī. Atquī modica firmitūdō poterat sufficere; 
nam acūtō cultrō leviter amputantur nucēs.—Prō scālīs ipsō in 
cocōrum sinū pār idōneum arborum succīdō, trīgintā ferē pedēs 
longārum, postquam capita dētrāxī. Utramque dēdolātam ⸤quantum 
possim sine dētrīmentō rōboris⸥ extenuō, ut quam levissimae sint 
scālae. Sānē erant cavae, (medullā quādam plēnae,) idcircō 
rōbustiōrēs, quam sī ejusdem fuissent ponderis et longitūdinis, 
sed solidae. Gradūs scālārum addō, ē lignīs atque ē fūne, ut in 
cubiculāribus meīs: sed trēs in summō fūnēs valdē laxōs 
relinquō, ut scālae applicātae quasi amplectantur arborem, nec 
possint dēlābī. Tālī īnstrūmentō adjūtus, crēdidī posse mē 
amplam nucum vim dēcerpere, quamquam plūrimae cocī ⸤longē 
prōcēriōrēs⸥ macacīs opulentam reservābant praedam. Haec, crēdō, 
in Majō mēnse fīnīta sunt. 197. Equidem coeōrum ūtilitātēs parum 
intellegēbam; sed plūrimās esse gnārus, nihil rejēceram. Frondēs 
pennāsve (sī ita licet dīcere) parvae illīus cocī, quam prō 
rēmīs succīdī, animadvertī paene tegulōrum[S] esse īnstar. Hās 
fūniculīs ita cōnsueram, ut cucullī[T] vicem optimē gesserint. 
Medullam cocōrum arborum atque aliārum palmārum statuō 
explōrandam: corticem omnem asservō. 

198. Grex, (quem propter sānitātem mātūrius in saltum 
trānsdūxī,) ēvulsīs solō pedicīs, in vallem rediit. Cūnctōs 
inveniō circā vetus praesaepe, herbās ⸤ūberrimās atque apprīmē 
succulentās⸥ summō cum gustātū rōdentēs. Pedicās dētrāxī, ipsās 
animantēs reputāns ā Nātūrā melius quam ā mē ēdocērī, ubinam 
potissimum dēgere oportēret. Quoniam cicurēs inveniō sībilōque 
fistulae oboedientēs, id mihi sufficit. Succurrit animō, quantum 
rōboris āmīserint vaccae nostrātēs domesticae, quam saepe 
difficilī partū torqueantur, per nostram importūnam cūrātiōnem. 
Vereor nē meum gregem immūtem, sī stultē ego mē immisceam. 199. 
Sērius, quum aurae stāgnārent calorque ingrueret, nōn ad saltum 
perrēxēre, sed ad apertum ac summum collem; fortasse quia 
culicēs vel oestrī urgēbant. Multō māne (crēdō) pāscēbantur, 
ante lūcem; posteā auram captantēs mīrē aprīcābantur summō in 
colle, ibīdem dormientēs. 200. Ego quoque in stāgnante aurā 
pertaesus cavernārum, postquam aliquot noctēs iterum inter rāmōs 
arboris dormīveram, melius fore crēdō, sī gregem sequar. Quārē 
multā ac difficilī māchinātiōne trēs asserēs longissimōs summō 
in colle sīc ērēxī, ut dē colligātīs capitibus lectus pēnsilis 
sustinērētur. Ego per fūnem ascendō, quī dēsuper fluitāns quasi 
in ānulōs nōdātur, in quōs ingredior. Ut prīmum lectulum 
attingerem, fūnem illum ad mē recipiēbam. Tālis erat novī 
cubīlis fōrma. 

201. Haec inter opera, ex novō quōdam juncō contexuī dorsuālem 
illam, dē quā dīxī, tegetem; item foliīs rōscidīs tum prīmum 
caput meum sub īnfulā condō. Etenim nimius erat fervor sōlis; 
quamquam calor nōn adeō suffōcābat quantum metueram. Illā in 
regiōne ipsīus aestātis nox longiuscula est, flābatque identidem 
siccā in tempestāte vespertīnus turbō ventī, quī āera 
refrīgerābat; necnōn quāvīs in nocte aura quaedam montāna 
superiōribus in locīs sentiēbātur. 202. Maris temperiem sēnsim 
augēscere crēdēbam; ego autem magis magisque lavācrīs captābam 
frīgus. Sī caput ac dorsum ā sōle dēfendās, aliō tegmine vix 
opus est, nisi propter culicēs; ego vērō, tenuissimē amictus, 
posse vidēbar multum labōris vel summā in aestāte perferre. 

203. Fīnītō quod maximē urgēret, parō humum optimam ab ōstiō 
flūminis ad portum trānsvehere, in quā dioscōreae serantur. 
Locum dēlēgī, quem possem ex rīvulō ⸤quotiēs vellem⸥ irrigāre. 
Hunc ad ūsum ligna aliquot sīc cavāvī, ut compluviī[U] īnstar 
essent. Rōbustissimās meās tabulās ad traham cūrātius 
cōnstrīnxī, ut humus ingesta nē efflueret. Duōbus jūmentīs 
bīduum convehō humum: traha sub rūpibus in plānō currit: cava 
loca impleō; quidquid fimī uspiam rejectum est, comportō, 
opperiorque tempus dioscōreīs ipsīs plantandīs. 

204. Multum fruēbar lectulō pēnsilī. Sub astrīs jūcundum erat 
frīgus, aliquandō tamen nimium. Nox decem hōrās dūrābat, ac sine 
crepusculō. Tot hōrās dormīre nōn possum, frīgēscō interdum sub 
nūdō aethere. Gregem comperiō pāscī trēs vel quattuor hōrās ante 
sōlem, dormīre post merīdiem: crēdō mē, iterum animālia 
imitantem, sequī Nātūram ducem. Ante sōlem exortum iīs rēbus 
operor, quibus lūx est minus necessāria: inter hās vēscendī 
operam numerō atque incēdendī sīve ad cavernās sīve ad vallem. 
Sed ūnusquisque diēs suum habuit colōrem suumque opus. 205. Jam 
crēdō advēnisse tempus frūctūs colligendī. Ūvās in hortīs 
inveniō multīs in locīs jam mātūrās. Aliquot gustātīs, magnam 
vim dēcerptam resticulīs suspendō, ut sōle ārēscant. Multōs per 
diēs hūc commeāns īdem faciō, plūrēsque frūctūs trahā reportō. 
206. Tum ricinum inveniō fruticem, ē quā oleum illud quod 
“castōreum” vulgō appellant, cōnficitur. Multō cum gaudiō 
maniocam inveniō, ex quā cōnficitur cassāva pānis. Hanc in 
Brazīliā nōveram: inde etiam excoquitur Tapioca Anglōrum. Porrō 
banāna vel mūsa hīs in locīs nāscēbātur, īnfrā autem nānās 
quāsdam palmās dactyliferās esse comperiō. 207. Aliō diē optimum 
repperī in mangā arbore terebinthum, crēdidīque mē hinc satis 
habēre posse, tum stuppae, tum terebinthī aut rēsīnae. Plūrēs 
frūctūs colligō vix exortō sōle, postquam ante lūcem ad hortōs 
pedibus incessī. Sī quandō ⸤fabrīlem propter operam⸥ validā 
nervōrum exercitātiōne opus sit, id aut ante sōlem perficiō, aut 
sub stēllīs lūnaeve lūce, taedīs aliquandō adjūtus. 208. Jam 
paulō audentior factus, canem habēns comitem,—sī ūsus venīret, 
sub arbore dormiēbam hōrīs merīdiānīs. Ē sopōre experrēctus, 
apparō traham, jungō jūmenta, ipse vehor in trahā, hortōs 
pōmerīdiānō tempore invīsō. Tum frūctūs ingerō, jūmentīs ad 
pāscendum solūtīs. Sī nimis vagentur, canis redūcit. Dēmum 
jūnctīs iterum ad traham, dēscendō cum onere pretiōsō. Nova mox 
ingruit difficultās, quum nōn sufficerent arcae prōtegendīs 
thēsaurīs. 

209. Tamen neutiquam satiāta est mea cupiditās. Ad cocōs nucēs 
dēmetendās falculam illam mēcum apportāvī; scālās novās ipsīs in 
hortīs relinquēbam. Dum autem īnfrā incēdō, ananassās videō 
multās, (māla pīnea vulgō nōs vocāmus): numquam ego anteā hās 
animadvertī. Jam intellegō et plūrimās esse et maximās, paene ex 
arēnīs cum cactīs nāscentēs. Ūnam illicō vīndēmiāvī, nec 
abstinuī quīn grande frustum comēderim. 210. Mox nucem cocōrum 
⸤ab humō sūmptam⸥ perforandō experior num sicca sit. Paulum 
lactis exsūgō,—dulce, spissum, nōn cōpiōsum. Plūrēs hārum 
colligō reservōque seorsum. Tum applicātīs scālīs, quicquid 
nucum vidēbātur maximum, id dēcerpō, duōsque faciō acervōs. 
Properē domum redeō cum ananassā illā ac falculā, et, paulum 
recreātus, in cymbā regredī ad hortōs volō. Attamen statum 
aestūs quum videō, et prōmontoria quae essent superanda, id vērō 
nōn ausus sum. 211. Tum subit cōgitātiō, quantō melius foret, sī 
scaphā possem reportāre; tanta erat cōpia, tanta varietās 
frūctuum oculōs et mentem captantium. Bis trahā hortōs invīsere 
ūnō in diē facinus erat magnum: quantum trahā possem reportāre, 
quīnquiēs id scapha portāret. Post aurōram, crēdō, lēnis aura 
favēbit: maris ⸤plūrēs per diēs⸥ aequor fuerat undīs expers. 
212. Jam dactylōs, banānās, cocōs nucēs, ananassās, ūvās, ad 
libitum mē habitūrum spērō: nimia mē spēs et nimia cupiditās 
festīnāvit. Crāstinō diē ⸤lēnī aurae⸥ vēla scaphae permīsī; illa 
per vitream ōceanī superficiem clēmentissimō mōtū dēlābitur; mox 
ultrā prōmontorium paulō vēlōcius dēvehor. Dēmum laetus ipsum 
attingō ōstium, et dētractō vēlō, rēmīs ingredior rīvum. 213. 
Multa avidīs oculīs lūstrāvī: quae acervāta erant, assūmpsī: 
plūrima alia abripuī. Sine morā impōnō omnia scaphae, et 
reciprocum iter cōnor. Tum vērō fortūna sē vertit. Stāgnante 
aurā, vēlum inūtile erat. Rēmīs incumbō, sed tardiusculē moveor. 
Nervīs contentīs, dēfatīgō mēmet, aestuōsā in hōrā. Tellūrem 
observāns, dubitō anne prōgrediar, maximā meā vī. Cohorreō, nē 
hāc in parte prōfluēns sit maris, quae mē in ignōtās aquās 
rapiat. Ūnī hominī certē nimia erat, nisi ventō marīque favente, 
hujus scaphae moderātiō. Igitur dēficior fortitūdine, et 
reflectō scapham in palmētum, quō tandem pervēnisse gaudeō, 
valdē dēfessus. 214. Ego vērō angor animī, quō pactō redūcī 
possit scapha. Rē amplius perpēnsā, crēdō numquam mē ausūrum eam 
marī committere iterum. Tunc maestissimē sōlitūdinem meam 
conquerēns, optābam ut iterum puer ille Maurus, quōcum ex 
Maurītāniā aufūgī, socius mihi nāvālis foret. Sed prōtinus mē 
cōnscientia objūrgat, quod propter servitūtem ejus, fortasse 
necessāriam, ego nummōs accēperim: itaque ingemēns, ōs in 
manibus recondidī. 215. Exinde tamquam in somniīs hilarem audīvī 
vōcem, Rebilī bebile libī bilī Ō! psittacus autem in humerō meō 
cōnsīdēbat. Is quidem rōstrō ac capitis plūmā genās meās 
dēmulcēbat, ac vōcēs profundēbat cārissimās. Sānē tangēbar. Quia 
sine comite meō prōcesseram, ille ad hortōs ⸤mē anquīrēns⸥ 
āvolāverat. Volāsse eum, minus accūrātē dīxī; quippe mancā 
etiamnum pennā, inter volātum atque oblīquum saltum prōcēdēbat. 
216. Tum replētā fiscellā, experior quantum possim humerīs 
sufferre incēdēns. Modicum bananārum et dactylōrum onus assūmō: 
vēscor quantum libet, bibō ē rīvulō, et, relictā scaphā, ascendō 
vallem. Pedibus jam siccīs, (nam aquā marīnā immersī erant) sub 
umbrā citrī per fervōrēs maximōs recondor, dormiōque paulum; 
dēmum nōtum per trāmitem ēvādō, maestusque assequor cavernās. 

217. Ex quantā calamitāte quam angustō discrīmine effūgissem, 
per meam tempestātum imperītiam, prōrsus nesciēbam: nam, trīduō 
post, turbō furiōsus ventōrum tōtum caelum pervertit cietque 
intimum mare. In cavernīs libēns mē recondō. Tum meminī Kalendās 
Septembrēs imminēre, quō in diē nāvis frācta est. Annō superiōre 
egēnus eram, inops, spē dēstitūtus: nunc opum multārum sum 
dominus et praeclārō fruor procellārum profugiō. Equidem librīs 
legendīs et calamī ūsū petō varietātem negōtiī. Quae fēcī, nōn 
libet hīc accūrātius nārrāre; sed librō illō mathēmaticō 
adjūtus, dedī operam ut fundāmenta ratiōnēsque mathēmaticās 
solidius probārem. 218. Ut prīmum crēdō saevās praeterīsse 
procellās, dēcernō in domesticum hortum incumbere. Dioscōreās 
circā quīnquāgintā praeparāveram, rādīcibus circumcīsīs: item 
septemdecim maniocās tractāveram pariter: hās omnēs in trahā 
reportātās rīte cōnsēvī: mox humum dē novō ⸤ā flūminis ōstiō 
convectam⸥ addidī, quia dē maniocā prius nōn cōgitāveram. 219. 
Macacōs vīdī frūctibus meīs īnsidiārī, item ⸤nesciō quae 
īnsecta⸥ aliquot hōrum corrūperat. Nōlō dē cibāriīs ānxius esse: 
alia multa opera cūram vīrēsque meās āvocant. Crēdō, quantum 
sine nimiō labōre possim convehere, tantum convehendum; nam 
nesciō utrum, seu rōbīgine seu īnsectīs sīve avibus aut macacīs, 
maxima pars rērum coacervātārum sit peritūra. Itaque rēs edūlēs 
avidē reposuī; porrō aliās rēs, ut ricinum,—ē quō facilius oleum 
extrūxī propter fabrīlēs ūsūs quam ex aliā quāpiam rē. 220. Sed 
arcae loculīque ad rēs asservandās nōn sufficiēbant. Quidquid 
habēbam ōllārum aut lagēnārum, adhibuī ananassīs, persicīs mālīs 
aliīsque frūctibus cōnservandīs. Ahēnum maximum oleō ricinī 
spurcum erat; nam quamquam arēnā ēmundāveram, manēbat quīdam 
odor et nauseam creābat. Nova vāsa fingere volēbam, immō magna, 
quae ut apud Maurōs, dōliōrum vicem sustinērent. 221. Prīma mea 
experīmenta valdē rudia erant. Dē fōrmā incūriōsus, argillam 
sōle siccāre et concoquere cōnor, sī massam aliquam possim satis 
cōnsolidāre. Laterēs potius quam ōllās cōnficiēbam: cito autem 
agnōvī, rem hāc viā nōn prōcēdere. Coctīs lateribus sine dubiō 
erat opus, ad furnum cōnstituendum; dein igne, nōn sōle, coctōs 
laterēs velim. 222. Herbās in sōle siccātās prō strāmine crūdīs 
lateribus intertexō, argillā prīmō subāctā: sīc faciō struem. 
Stīpitēs viridēs cum siccō lignō mixtōs interpōnō atque compōnō: 
mox subjiciō ignem. Māteriē renovātā lentum calōrem per tōtum 
diem sustentō: posterō diē (quoniam nōn vidēbātur ignis 
sufficere) violentius incendō: jamque laterēs bene coctī erant 
et solidī. Merō lutō et lateribus illīs (sine gypsō, quod ex 
rūpe calcāriā potuissem combūrendō cōnficere) furnum cōnstrūxī. 
223. Omittō nārrāre, quō pactō in experīmentum prīmō fēcerim 
ōllās. Cēterum explōrātō, posse mē plumbō liquefactō vitream 
quondam faciem superpōnere, id quod propter munditiam concupīvī, 
optimum crēdidī, quam maximē quadrāta fingere ingentia vāsa; 
quoniam haec fōrma omnium esset facillima. Plūra hōrum, fateor, 
praeter aciem rīmās ēgērunt; sed rēs solidās, nōn liquidās, 
recondēbam; itaque meīs ūsibus aliquātenus serviēbant. 

224. Cēterum ut tēlōrum artem probē exercērem, intimō in portū 
clipeum quendam ingentem, velut mētam scopumve, ērēxī. Compāgēs 
erat ex assulīs: vēlōrum praetēnsīs laciniīs, in mediō (prō 
taurīnō, quem vocant, oculō) pullum lānam affīxī. Ūnamquamque 
ignipultārum suā in vice exercēbam, aliquandō majōribus 
glandibus, aliquandō aut olōrīnīs aut minimīs: sed plumbum omne 
dīligenter recollēgī, quantum poteram: spatia quoque sēdulō 
notāvī, ut in collīneandō perītior fierem. Nisi mē aliquō modō 
aut exercērem aut oblectārem, maestitia mē incessit; etenim nōn 
jam labōribus fatīgābar. 225. Sed multus eram tunc temporis in 
coquendō et condiendō, nē frūctūs perīrent plūrēs. Ōllās 
Eurōpaeās aliquot habēbam, sed operculīs egēbam, quae āera 
exclūderent. Ē mangīs rēsīnam quandam ēlicuī, quā velut pice 
oblinerem vēlōrum laciniās. Hae, operculīs circumdatae, satis 
bene conclūdēbant ōllās; at rēsīnam dē novō superlēvī. 226. 
Oblītus sum quaedam dē ējectāmentīs maris nārrāre. Ūnō in dōliō 
plūra invēnī ōrnāmenta, praesertim specilla ac vitreās bullās. 
Specillōrum ōrae dētrīmentum tulērunt; sed bullae erant 
incolumēs. Trēs item fasciculōs invēnī, discolōrum vestium 
plēnōs. Postquam aperuī, sub umbrā expōnendās dēcernō. Nōn 
integra fuit colōrum pulchritūdō, necnōn plūrēs vestium quasi 
rigēscēbant. Omnēs in cavernīs reposuī, sī forte posthāc ūtilēs 
fierent. Bullās autem plūrimās, resticulīs, sīve fīlīs 
conjūnctōs, super jūmentōrum cervīcibus ōrnandī causā suspendī. 



CAPUT (IX.) NŌNUM. 


227. Tālēs inter cūrās exercēbar, quandō nova rēs mē vehementer 
excitāvit, Octōbrī mēnse. Quōdam māne, dum eram in culīnā, mare 
versus aspiciēns, repente videō nāvigium, nigrīs hominibus 
plēnum, quod ad portum meum vidēbātur tendere. Haesitō exanimis, 
neque audeō in armāmentārium excurrere, nē cernar; metuōque nē 
animadvertant aut rētia mea aut trāmitem. Appellunt sub caeruleā 
rūpe, extrahuntque captīvum, cui bracchia post tergum erant 
retorta. Dum obstupēscō contemplāns, subitō in nāvigium redeunt 
cum captīvō et rēmigantēs abeunt. Extemplō alterum videō 
nāvigium, quod prōmontorium caeruleae rūpis studet exsuperāre: 
jam intellegō priōrēs eōdem tendere, nē ā sociīs suīs 
dīviderentur. 228. Ut prīmum ēvānuēre, surgō. Ignipultam 
corripiō bitubam, quae Helvēticī mīlitis fuerat; quā quidem hāc 
in īnsulā numquam ūsus eram, praeterquam in exercitandō, quotiēs 
in clipeum collīneārem. Quum paulō gravior esset, furcam quandam 
prō fulcrō adhibēbam: quā in terram dēfīxā, multō certius 
jaculābar. Utrumque tubum nunc dīligenter suffarciō, hunc magnā 
glande, illum olōrīnīs; item pār pistolārum. Vēscor parcē; 
placentam in sinū vestis recondō. Accīnctus balteō, gladium 
sūmō, pistolās, bitubam suā cum furcā, item prōspeculum, quod dē 
collō suspēnsum gerēbam fūniculō crassiōre, quia lōrīs dēlicātīs 
dēficiēbar. Pērulam quoque capiō, pulveris ac pilulōrum 
repositōrium. Tum aliquotiēs ad Nūmen Suprēmum vōta vel precēs 
attollēns, ēgredior prōspectūrus. Canem abēgī, quī mē comitārī 
voluit. 229. Ad speculam meam quantā poteram celeritāte ascendō. 
Inde videō circiter vīgintī quīnque virōs cum duōbus captīvīs. 
Ignem jam accenderant: mox ūnum ē captīvīs nūdum in arēnā 
extendunt, caput clāvā obterunt, et cōnfestim membra discerpunt. 
Cultrōs nōn clārē dispexī, sed (quod horrōrem simul ac nauseam 
mihi mōvit) torrefactīs membrīs vēscuntur. Dum facinus exsecror, 
crēdō licēre mihi, sī possim, omnēs trucīdāre, quī hospitium 
īnsulae meae tam foedē violent. Ego autem cōnsēdī immōtus et 
tamquam fascinātus. 

230. Repente alium videō captīvum praeter ōram maris fugere: 
hunc quīnque persequuntur summō ārdōre. Ille, collēs versus 
tendēns, pōne rūpem ēvānēscit. Tum exsurgēns currō, cavēns tamen 
nē exanimis fīam; tandem iterum fugitīvum discernō. Viam Lūnātam 
ascendit; pōne trēs virī sectantur, quōrum prīmus clāvam habuit 
bellicam. Duo illī sagittās. Fugitīvum crēdō ā prīmō secūtōre 
vēlōcitāte superārī, tantummodo praeoccupāsse cursum. Ego in 
fossā quādam lateō, dēfīgōque furcam in solō. 231. Intellegō 
fugitīvum nōn posse ēvādere: etenim anhēlābat graviter. Ā prīmō 
secūtōre prehēnsus, ab illīs necābitur; sed opperior dum prope 
veniant. Tranquillissimē collīneō, dein olōrīnīs pilulīs 
jaculor. Illicō prōstrātus cadit prīmus secūtor. Saltat metū 
fugitīvus, fragōrem audiēns, sed nescit prīmō quid acciderit. 
Mox capite īnflexō respiciēns, vīdit hostem dējectum: tum ipse 
quoque subsistit, animam recipiēns. Secundus adhūc currit: jam 
sagittā arcuī applicātā parat trānsfīgere fugitīvum. Id mē 
iterum accendit, nec tamen occīdere eum volō. Glande majōre ex 
alterō tubō crūra ejus petō, afflīgōque āctūtum. Quī tertius 
accurrit, duōs sociōs prōstrātōs cernēns, audītōque fragōre, 
summā celeritāte retrō cēdit. Mox duōs aliōs quī pōne 
sectābantur, hic vertit retrō; itaque ēvānuēre omnēs. 232. Tum 
egomet ēgredior. Fugitīvus obstupēscēbat etiam. Tandem accurrit, 
et cōram prōvolūtus, terram fronte tangit. Id erat prō 
venerātiōne. Excitō hunc, et, Anglicē loquēns, plānē tamquam 
intellegat, imperō ut mēcum veniat. Vulnerātōs volō invīsere. 
Posterior volūtābātur humī, nec potuit surgere; tamen ab arcū 
ejus aliquantum metuī. Sed fugitīvus circumsultāns arcum ē manū 
ejus ēripit: prōtinus correptī erat oblīsūrus faucēs, nisi ego 
īrātissimā vōce prohibuissem. 

233. Vulnerātus ille stolidē admīrātur: angor (crēdō) vulneris 
metum domuerat; nam per femur trānsfossus est. Fugitīvum jussī 
bracchia vulnerātī manibus cōnstringere, fūnemque ē loculīs 
petiī, frūstrā. Sed fūniculum illum collō dētrāxī, quī 
prōspeculum meum sustinēbat: hic prō compede sufficiēbat. Dein 
vulnere īnspectō, mappam ē loculīs vestis meae extractam 
applicō, et linteīs īnfulae firmiter ligō. 234. Tum fugitīvō 
imperāvī, ut mēcum tollat virum et in proximō quōdam cavō 
repōnat. Nōn reluctātur ille saucius: crēdō eum, quum vulnera 
ligārem, intellēxisse tāle facinus nōn inimīcī esse. Sed ad 
prīmum secūtōrem convertēns mē, mortuum esse cognōscō; fortasse 
in cor penetrāverant pilulae. Cōnfestim fugitīvum accersēns, 
revīsō speculum. Ēn autem! duo illa nāvigia jam sunt in marī, 
abeuntque: id quod mihi erat grātissimum. Crēdidī eōs, 
perterritōs quasi mīrāculō, aufūgisse. 235. In rē tam novā vix 
mē recolligō; spatium cōnsīderandī cupiō; sed fugitīvus mē 
suscitat, ōsculāns tālōs meōs. Equidem tum ejus dēmulceō genās, 
jubeōque mē sequī. Dēscendō ad cavernās: vestem induō, cibōs 
appōnō, ipse quoque vēscor. Veste sānē ac cibō gaudet, mox 
iterum iterumque mē venerātur. 236. At ego traham parō cum 
duōbus jūmentīs. Quandō gregem aspexit, videō quantum excitētur. 
Impōnō trahae lectī vestīmenta, ligōnem ac pālam quandam. Arma 
mea, praeter gladium, exuor: tum cum fugitīvō ac cane ascendō 
novum meum trāmitem, jūmenta dūcēns. Longiōre hōc circuitū 
regressus ad mortuum, incipiō humum ligōne aperīre, ut corpus 
recondam. Id vērō fugitīvus mē nōn vult facere: sūmit 
ferrāmenta, operam strēnuē perficit: tum mortuum humō obtegimus. 
Clāvam ejus cūriōsus asservāvī. 237. Exinde sine morā sauciātum 
hominem in traham assūmptum reportō, et gestū signīsque benignīs 
permulceō. Profectō voluī hominem sānāre, nec ignārus eram 
quantum impedīret sānātiōnī pavor et ānxietās. Quārē quidquid 
potuī excōgitāre, fēcī, tamquam frātrī. Aquam libenter bibit, 
vēscī nōluit. Postquam vulnus summā meā ope sēdulō cūrāvī, hunc 
relinquō: dein fugitīvī manūs parō ligāre, ut videam quō sē modō 
gestūrus sit. 238. Is autem, genibus prōcumbēns, summā 
humilitāte manūs offert, ut colligem, sī velim. Id satis erat. 
Ego subrīdēns fūnem retrahō: ille rūrsus gestū dēmōnstrat, velle 
sē mihi servīre: atque ego accipiō. Jubeō in arēnā cōnsīdere. 
Ipse sēricam umbellam, fastūs causā, efferō, et sub hāc 
compositus, in optimā meā sellā sedēns, dēlīberō quid faciendum. 

239. Arbitror duōs hōs virōs prō servīs et prō amīcīs esse mihi 
ā Deō datōs, sī hōrum possim et venerātiōnem et cāritātem 
conciliāre. Utrumque arguō per mē esse morte ēreptum; quoniam, 
ille alter nē strangulētur, id per mē stetit. Utrīque crēdidī 
novam prōrsus esse vim jactūs igneī. Igitur spērābam mentibus 
eōrum posse mē dominārī. Dēcernō largam cāritātem majestāte 
temperātam adhibēre. Prōtenus fugitīvō indō nōmen Ēlāpsō; 
alterum appellō Secūtōrem. 240. Sed novus mē incessit timor, nē 
Ēlāpsus, cymbā vīsā, ēvādet rēmigāns; quārē rēmōs prīmō 
recondidī. Porrō, sī domō sōlus abīrem, vinciēbam Ēlāpsum; sed, 
domum reversus, nōn solvī modo, sed blandissimē alloquēbar, 
Anglicā linguā prōrsus garriēns. Optimōs dabam cibōs, socium 
operis assūmēbam, industriam ejus collaudāns: multa docuī, mox 
ab eō multa quoque didicī. Vīdī eum esse grātum et sēdulō 
oboedīre. Lēnī cum rīsū vinciēbam eum; necnōn ille rīdēbat, 
saepius ōsculābātur manūs meās. Sed ante nūndinās tertiās 
pudēbat mē vincīre, nec jam faciēbam. 241. Jam quō magis ambōbus 
augērem reverentiam meī, spectāculum jaculātiōnis māchinātus 
sum. Duās tabulās ostentō ligneās: dēmōnstrō ambōs esse lēvēs, 
sine pūnctō vel incīsūrā. Ūnam pōne alteram apposuī, modicō 
intervāllō; sīc autem ut Secūtor, quamvīs claudus, aspiceret. 
Dein ē parvā pistolā ēmittō ignem. Glāns, trānsverberātā priōre 
tabulā, dēfoditur in secundum. Igne ac dētonātiōne territī 
ejulābant ambō: mox vīsā glande, Ēlāpsus priōrem scrūtātur 
tabulam, et mīrābundus Secūtōrī dēmōnstrat parvum, immō minimum, 
forāmen. Nec alteruter audēbat pistolam tangere. Ipsam rem 
volueram. Post paulō Ēlāpsum per prōspeculum meum aspectāre 
fēcī; id quod cum admīrātiōne commovet. Prōcēdente autem tempore 
hōrologium meum ostentāvī, apertīs interiōribus māchināmentīs. 
Tālibus rēbus crēdēbam barbarōrum mentēs salūbriter capī. 242. 
Jam magnam faciō jactūram. Gnārus quantum barbarīs noceant vīna 
ārdentia, ānxius nē hīs aliquandō dēprāvātī sint atque efferātī, 
quidquid hujus generis habēbam, Deō invocātō, effūdī, praeter 
ūnam lagunculam, quam idcircō in arcānīs reposuī, sī forte prō 
medicīnā aliquandō foret ūtilis. 243. Nōndum memorāvī, Secūtōrem 
bonīs esse indūtum sandaliīs, Ēlāpsī pedēs nūdōs fuisse. Uterque 
praecīnctōrium gerēbat, Secūtor balteum quoque cum cōrȳtō 
sagittāriō. Sandalia illa ē cortice erant plicāta; Ēlāpsus 
autem, dum sedet domī ōtiōsus, ā mē quidem vīnctus, sandalia 
propter meōs ūsūs imprīmīs, dein propter suōs, ē meā vetere 
māteriā cōnfēcit. Tālem virum cūr vincīre oportēbat? 244. Ego 
rūrsum illī dōnō vestem versicolōrem, ex iīs quās ex marī 
recuperāveram. Is accipit grātus. Post trīduum videō eum hāc 
veste fulgentem: colōrum splendor, quī aliquantum erat 
immūtātus, integer redierat. Interrogō eum Anglicē, unde hoc 
mīrāculum? Rīdet ille, laetāturque, sed linguā nequit explicāre. 
245. Necnōn omīsī nārrāre, lacernam propter nocturnum praesertim 
frīgus utrīque mē dedisse; id quod libentissimē accēpēre. Etenim 
Secūtor, quī ambulāre nequībat, frīgus sī quod erat, graviter 
persentiēbat; quārē accūrātius eum prōtegēbam; et sānē grātus 
animī vidēbātur. Ego autem multīs signīs doceō, illōs inter sē 
amīcissimōs esse dēbēre. 246. Tandem Ēlāpsum in cymbā mēcum 
collocō, post mātūtīnam pluviam. Mēnsis fortasse Februārius 
erat, serēnum caelum, mare tranquillum. Ad tertium rēmigō sinum, 
ubi horrendum illud epulum vīdī. Tum subit animum, foedās 
reliquiās nōn esse āmōtās: nec fallēbar. Ipsō in locō ossa 
trucīdātī virī albēscēbant. Carnis reliquiās aut avēs aut 
īnsectae abolēverant; sed calvāriam hūmānam quīvīs nōverit: item 
spīnam dorsī atque alia. Ēlāpsus, pietāte (crēdō) gentīliciā 
mōtus, arēnā manibus corrāsā, omnēs hās reliquiās quamvīs 
maerēns dēfodit. Mox ad aliās rēs convertimur. Arborēs ille 
magnō contemplātur gaudiō, fruticēsque explōrat dīligentissimē, 
folia multa asportat. 247. Nē longus sim, ut prīmum verbīs 
explicāre poterat, plūrimōs indicābat mihi fruticum atque 
arborem ūsūs: hinc et oleō et fūnibus cito abundābam. Ex humilī 
quōdam rubō oleum hic mihi extrāxit, itaque nōn jam cōnfugiendum 
erat ad ricinum. Mox tria magnī pretiī indicāvit legūmina, inter 
ūmidiōra convallis; prīmum, rāpa maxima et optima, nostrātibus 
solidiōra et suāviōra; deinde, quiddam ē fabārum genere, grande 
ac bonum sānē. Dē Aegyptiōrum fabā audīvī. Nesciō an haec et 
illa cōnsimilēs fuerint. Tum genus quoddam, ut putābam, 
cucurbitae; sed fōrmā ferē cylindricā, velut pulvīnulum, colōre 
purpureō, optimā cucumī praestantius. Posteā īdem orȳzam dētēxit 
ūmidīs in locīs, quōs ego ēvītāveram. Porrō gossypium mihi 
retēxit. Ex aliīs rēbus stuppās quāsdam vel villōs extrāxit, 
cannabī vel līnō parēs. 

248. Aliam quandam rem voluit Ēlāpsus mē docēre, sed intellegere 
nequībam. Grandiōrēs aliquot avēs, quās ego phāsiānīs rettulī 
dum propius praeter volant, ille manibus plaudēns columbās et 
caprās esse dīcit. Prīmō sīc interpretātus sum, ut dīceret hās 
edūlēs esse, ut carnem columbīnam et caprīnam. Posteā explicātum 
est, hās avēs posse domārī et mānsuēscere, ut caprās columbāsque 
meās: dē quō sērius nārrābō. 249. Itidem dē palmīs multa ille mē 
docuit. Equidem nōveram aliās esse nuciferās, quās cocōs 
appellābam; aliās phoenīcēs, vel dactyliferās, nānās illās 
quidem meā in īnsulā. Jam discō, tertium genus et funiferum esse 
et saccharum praebēre; caryōtum appellārī audiō. Mollissimī 
fīunt hinc restēs, tamquam lōra optimē depsta, quī propter 
capistra jūmentōrum aut cingula possunt adhibērī, necnōn propter 
balteōs. Attamen ex asperō nucum villō rōbustiōrēs contexuntur 
fūnēs, crassae tegetēs, scōpae rigidae. 250. Quārtum dīxit esse 
oleiferum; id quod in Brazīliā quoque audieram; anne prōrsus 
eadem arbor sit, nesciō. Quīntum porrō nōbilissimum, rōbore 
prōcērissimō et optimō, cujus folia prō umbellā essent. Dēnique 
ex tribus generibus ad minimum, oleum, vīnum, saccharum, ab ūnō 
cēram, ab aliō farīnam optimam, prōvenīre. Sed mē juvābat, 
ūnumquidque inde sūmere, unde minimī esset labōris. 251. Tam 
cito tot rēs Anglicē Ēlāpsus didicit, ut crēderem posse mē jam, 
hōc ministrō, scapham redūcere. Equidem in hortōs eum dēdūxī, 
ubi multa mē docuit: sed melius arbitrābar, ad redūcendam 
scapham, Secūtōris opperīrī vīrēs. 252. Ille ex vulnere 
convalēscēbat, et summam mihi dēmōnstrābat reverentiam. Ut 
prīmum sine perīculō rēptāre poterat, ad focum accēdēbat, rem 
culīnāriam observābat, paulātim ipse coquēbat, et quae Anglicē 
dīcēbam, coepit intellegere, etsī pauciōra cum eō locūtus eram, 
quam eum Ēlāpsō, quī mihi erat socius labōrum. Glāns plumbea 
sine dubiō ē crūre ejus exierat: nihil intus remānsit, quārē 
simplicior erat ejus cūrātiō, dōnec solidē convaluit. 

253. Quōdam diē Ēlāpsus vitreās illās bullās caprīs dētrahit, 
et, humillimē mē venerātus, meō collō circumpōnit. Ego rīdēns 
dōlium eī ostendō, ubi plūrēs habeō bullās; mox dētractās collō 
meō caprīs parō reddere. Ille vērō reclāmat, obtestātur: tunc ē 
dōliō aliquās dēlēgit, quae lūcentissimae vidēbantur; hās 
significat mihi convenīre. Minōrēs quāsdam ac minus fulgentēs 
suō collō suspendendās rogat. 254. Quamquam prīmō irrīdēbam, mox 
videō rem nōn esse contemnendam. Nōn barbarī sōlum, vērum omnēs 
hominēs rēgem suum vel imperātōrem īnsignibus imperiī decorātum 
volunt. Majestātī meae conveniēbat, ut rēgium aliquod īnsigne 
gestārem. Itaque dēmum hīs bullīs, quās prō rēgulōrum Āfrōrum 
lēnōciniō imperāveram, egomet rēgium quiddam inesse opīnor. 255. 
Sī autem in rēgnō meō ad rēs ōrdinandās gradūs quōsdam honōris 
cōnstituam, Ēlāpsus sine dubiō summus minister rēgius esse 
dēbeat, et secundāriīs gemmīs fulgere. Ingenium quoque ejus 
versūtius esse et capācius quam Secūtōris cognōveram, ut erant 
hī virī valdē disparēs. 256. Ēlāpsus gracilis erat, prōcērus, 
amplā fronte, micantibus oculīs, vultū valdē mōbilī, ōre autem 
suāvissimō. Secūtor humerīs lātior erat, minus prōcērus, genīs 
plēniōribus, vultū nōn malō illō quidem sed tardiōre. Crūra, 
bracchia, crassiōra quam Ēlāpsī, quī quidem vix summās suās 
vīrēs attigerat. Hunc crēdidī tria et vīgintī annōs aetātis 
habēre, Secūtōrem trīgintā vel amplius. Ut, quae ⸤meī vicārius⸥ 
Ēlāpsus jubēret, Secūtor oboedīret, prōfore crēdidī, sī Ēlāpsum 
quasi magistrātūs īnsignibus decorārem. Itaque monīlia illa, 
majōra et minōra, mihi atque Ēlāpsō comprobāvī. 257. Inter haec 
rē fabrīlī Ēlāpsum exerceō, ūsumque doceō omnis meae 
supellectilis. Jam intellegēbat omnia ferē quae dīcerem, sed 
loquī vix cōnābātur, praeter aliquot vocābula negandī, 
affirmandī, approbandī, interrogandī. Artem ego ferrāriam neque 
exercueram neque multum fortasse sōlus potuissem: sed quum ille 
dē ferrāmentīs cūriōsum sē dēmōnstrat, nova mē ambitiō capit, sī 
forte, hīs ministrīs, ars quoque illa mihi serviat. Nunc explicō 
tantum, per ignem et malleum rem cōnficī. 258. Barbarōrum 
uterque contexendīs vīminibus, juncīs, arundinibus, cannīs, 
valdē excellēbat. Quidquid hujus modī ego cōnfēcī, erat sānē 
inhabile. Jam vērō illī magnam mihi vim quālōrum, corbium, 
fiscōrum rapidē contexunt, Ēlāpsō māteriem hārum rērum 
comportante; necnōn, quod praesertim mihi cordī erat, idōneās 
perficiunt caligās textilēs. Ut aquam exclūderent, rēs nūllīus 
mōmentī vidēbātur, sī lapidum ac saxōrum asperitātēs, necnōn 
īnsectās dēfenderent. 259. Secūtor autem in rē coquīnāriā 
excellēbat. Ē cocōrum nucibus placentās dēlicātissimās, item 
quasi flōrem quandam lactis, faciēbat. Piscēs, dioscōreās, 
maniocēs, banānās, plūrimās nucēs ita condītās prōferēbat, ut 
nihil suprā: etenim prō condīmentīs habēbat ananassās, 
zingiberim, piper et alia arōmata, saccharum ē palmīs et oleum 
vel optimum. Mox, postquam inter silvās vagārī potuit, avēs 
plūrimās īnsidiīs capiēbat; unde nūllō nitrātī pulveris 
dispendiō, suāve habēbāmus epulum. Porrō fruticem invenit, cujus 
foliīs in sōle dēsiccātīs aquam aspergēbat calefactam: hōrum jūs 
tepidum, saccharō admixtō, praesertim cum flōre cocī lacteō, 
grātissimum fuit. Pōtiōnem foliāceam appellābam. 260. Saepius 
mēcum dēlīberāvī, anne satis tūtō secūrēs penes hōs virōs 
relinquerem: videō tamen, sī quid in hāc rē sit perīculī, id 
fortiter dissimulandō optimē dēfendī. Sī suspīciōnem fassus erō, 
prāvum cōnsilium ipse submonēbō. Tēla omnia āmovēre, quae 
possint esse letālia, prōrsus nōn possum. Sī (quod minimē est 
vērī simile) ambō hominēs in mē conjūrābunt, fortasse vix poterō 
servārī; nam igniāria mea tēla surripient. Sed nisi conjūrābunt, 
alteruter mihi auxiliābitur: nec crēdō aliēnārī posse ambōrum 
animōs, dum majestātem ac vim meam benignitāte temperō. 261. Hīs 
rēbus perpēnsīs, quia lūsus corporeus mentem levat, lūdum 
gladiātōrium dēcernō. Etenim sī redeant barbarī, sī dēpugnāre 
cōgāmur, meōs virōs velim totidem barbarīs longē praestāre; at 
sī neque suās habeant sagittās neque fūsilī plumbō exerceantur 
neque gladiīs bonīs rem gerant, īnferiōrēs barbarīs fīant. 
Igitur Ēlāpsum prōtenus, Secūtōrem simul ac sānitās permīsit, 
gladiātōriam doceō artem. 

262. Vīmineīs quibusdam mūnīmentīs caput, humerōs, crūra 
prōtegimur, ut magnā vī possīmus sine perīculō caesim ferīre; et 
effūsōs ex ictibus habēbāmus rīsūs. Posteā lūdum variābam, nē 
ūllā ratiōne pugnandī dēficerent. Sānē ventrem, pectus, vultum 
prōtegere, sī hostis pūnctim petat, longē difficilius est. 
Spissā tegete ac lārvā rōbustā armātūram concinnāvī; sed ipsī 
vīminea scūta fēcērunt, quae, laevō bracchiō gestāta, ictūs 
repellerent. Videō tamen hanc lūdī fōrmam, quantumvīs obtūsum 
sūmās prō gladiō baculum, oculīs et ventrī esse perīculōsam. 
Psittacus autem rē gladiātōriā abhorrēbat cūnctā, multōque cum 
ejulātū absiliēbat. 263. Mox Secūtor, quī suum retinēbat arcum 
atque aliquot sagittās, pennīs anatum ac ferreīs clāvīs vult 
sagittās novās fabricārī. Ipsīus sagittīs mucrōnēs ex piscium 
ossibus erant, nam ferrī suā in gente exstābat nihil. Clāvōs eōs 
quotquot maximē vidērentur idōneī, libēns dōnō; is autem valdē 
perītum sē ostendit, quum īnsuper līmam et cultrum operī 
commodō. 264. At ego vel parvam catapultam magnō arcuī longē 
antepōnēbam, pigēbatque mē quod pessulum ejus tractōrium chartā 
dēscrībere, nēdum lignō fingere, tam difficile vidērētur. Sed 
calamīs et chartā dēsignandō meditor, experior, dōnec pessulum 
cum tālō suō tandem rēctē excōgitāverim. 265. Tum caprārum 
cornua, quae reservāveram, exquīrō, et idōneum prōpōnēns 
stīpitem caedō, sculpō, terebrō: dēnique mollissimō ē lignō, 
satis magnā cum dīligentiā, rude et grande cōnstituō exemplar: 
quō vīsō tōtam rem intellēxēre. Itaque ipsīs opus remīsī 
ēlegantius perficiendum; nec spē meā falsus eram, nam catapultās 
haud spernendās post paulō cōnfēcērunt. Ego autem glandēs 
idōneās ē plumbō cōnfēcī, sed spīculā avēbam. 



CAPUT (X.) DECIMUM. 


266. Circiter id temporis statuī scapham, sī possem, redūcere, 
nē vēla prōrsus corrumperentur. Ēlāpsus autem jam satis 
intellegēbat, quid jubērem. Malleum, clāvōs, serram parvam, 
argillam vitreāriam,[V] acūs sarcināriās, fūniculōs, vēlōrum 
aliquot laciniās, in mulctrālī composuī: haec Ēlāpsus portat. 
Ego cibum, pōculum, cultellum, pistolās portō. Flūmen convallis 
vadō trānsīvimus, saxīs adjūtī modicīs, quōrum ope crēdēbam 
pontem sine magnō opere posse cōnstruī. Sīc breviōre cursū ad 
scapham pertingimus. 267. Prīmum vēla expandō, īnspiciō, tentō: 
tribus in locīs valdē īnfirma esse opīnor. Dēnotō, ubi 
resarcienda sint: id Ēlāpsus strēnuē perficit. Intereā mulctrālī 
aquam pluviālem marīnamque scaphā exhauriō: frūctūs in aquā 
putrēscentēs vehementer āversor: subtus inveniō solida omnia, 
nec quidquam rīmārum esse timendum. Fabrī ope nōn egent tabulae; 
itaque perfectīs vēlīs ingredimur. 268. Aura, sīcut 
expectāveram, adversa erat. Rēmigāmus ex ōstiō, dein expānsīs 
vēlīs, ad dextram excurrimus, gubernante Ēlāpsō, id quod optimē 
calluit: ego jubeō et vēla regō. Ut prīmum dēflectendum in 
terram opīnor, exclāmō “Ad sinistram!” et prōtinus torqueō vēla. 
Oboedit ille: scapha optimē convertitur: tunc praecipuus meus 
dēcessit timor. Sine ūllō perīculī sēnsū prīmum illud 
exsuperāmus prōmontorium, quamvīs adversante ventō, posteā 
celerius proficīscentēs praevertimur, dēnique lītus intrā cautēs 
legimus usque ad portum meum, ubi in nāvāle scapham laetus 
repōnō. 269. Ego autem Ēlāpsum interrogō, “Anne bona sit 
scapha?” Respōnsum exspectābam, “Sīc, sīc;” vel “Bona, bona:” 
sed admīror, quum ille clārē ac dēlīberātē respondet, “Bona nōn 
est; bonam faciēmus posthāc.” Iterum interrogō, Cūr? Is vērō 
quasi novam vōcis facultātem exhauserit, nihil respondet nisi, 
“Sīc.” 

270. Quod cibōs collēgeram et sēveram longē amplius quam quod 
mihimet, ūnī virō, erat opus, sānē gāvīsus eram: sed quum 
Secūtor, injussū meō, in agellō meō novam operam inciperet, 
īrācundius paulō ratiōnem ejus reī reposcō. Is humillimē manibus 
ac vultū dēprecāns, “Sīc optimē” esse cōnfirmat. Ego vērō 
gaudeō, quod, tardior ingenior quī vīsus erat, per sē possit 
bonās operās excōgitāre; nec diū est, quum videō, in hortulō eum 
pariter atque in culīnā fore ūtilem. Jūmentīs īdem gaudēbat; 
inde spēs mihi, fore ut ex dīversīs famulōrum ingeniīs 
cumulātior prōvenīret opera nostra. 271. Ut prīmum, sānātō 
crūre, natāre ausus est, admodum gestiēbat; nam propter tepōrem 
maris, nigrītae omnēs natandī sunt studiōsissimī. Equidem post 
prīmum illum diem numquam in ipsum mare mē committēbam, nē intrā 
cautēs quidem; tanta mē timiditās in sōlitūdine invāsit: in 
portū modo natābam. Sed cum Ēlāpsō etiam inter frāctōs flūctūs 
amābam lūdere; mox aquā, velut tēlō, inter natandum, avēs 
grallātōriās petēbāmus, quō in lūdō ācerrimum sē Secūtor 
ostentābat. 272. Oleō jam abundāns, sāpōnem facere voluī; nec 
poteram Secūtōrī, quid vellem, explicāre. Algās vērē marīnās 
plūrium generum cremāvī: eārum cinerēs oleō admixtās igne 
lentissimō percoquēbam, aquā calidiōre circumpositā. Item ē 
mangārum frūctū quum spissum quandam extrāxissem rēsīnam, hanc 
oleō commixtam itidem dēcoxī. Post aliquot experīmenta, duōbus 
modīs sāpōnem nōn ita malum cōnfēcī: tum omnem rem perspexit 
Secūtor, mēque in sāpōne compōnendō facile superāvit. Ūsum autem 
sāpōnis ēdocuī, atque exinde in cūrandō corpore ūtēbar. 273. 
Rīdeō sānē, quum videō quantā ille superbiā aurīgam sē ē trahā 
jactet, in vīlissimō quōdam scamillō sedēns, tribus jūmentīs 
vectus. Cēterum omnia quae imperāverim, rēctē perficit, ūsūque 
trahae impetrātō, multās reportat rādīcēs cum ipsārum humō: hās 
dīvidit aut circumcīdit, fimum cūrātissimē ingerit; dēmum satis 
magnō cum labōre amplum facit sēminārium. Tum mēcum arguō, sī 
nimium praeparētur cibī, id minimē culpandum, quoniam trēs virī 
vescī ē meō oportēbit: item industriōs hominēs nōn ē suīs 
labōribus effugitūrōs; jam prō patriā adoptāsse hanc īnsulam. 
274. Ēlāpsus quoque suās inveniēbat operās: atque ego, dum 
uterque mihi, quidquid jubeam, oboediat, gaudeō quod līberrimā 
ūtuntur dīligentiā, neque socordiae sint amantēs. Tamen nē 
subitō dēfessī concidant, saepius excōgitābam, aut lūdō aut 
varietāte, levāmenta labōris. Rēmigandō, piscandō, gladiātōriīs 
lūdīs, natandō quotīdiē, tēlīs et catapultā, ōrdinārium opus 
variābātur. 275. Tunc autem texendō vel plicandō praesertim 
exercēbat sē Ēlāpsus, nec quidnam cōnficeret, satis 
intellegēbam. Ex cannīs diffissīs quasi tabulās complicat artē 
rēticulātās, juncōsque sīc internectit, ut forāmina conclūdat. 
Levissimum sānē erat opus, quamquam firmum. Artem ejus admīrāns, 
quaerō tandem, quōrsum haec spectent. Respondet, “Propter 
scapham, sed ferrō quoque opus esse.” 276. Amplius interrogantī, 
tōtum suum prōpositum explicat, partim verbīs, partim rem ipsam 
dēmōnstrandō. Ait, scapham in fluviō esse nōn semper malam, in 
marī cum vēlō plēnam perīculī; quippe quae neque flūctūs neque 
vim ventī tolerāre possit. Duplex opus scaphae esse addendum. Nē 
flūctus ā fronte supercurrēret, ērigendam tamquam lōrīcam in 
prōrā, dein praeter latera quasi ālās expandendās, sed hās 
firmandās ferrō. Id mihi esse cūrandum, sē parātūrum cētera. 
277. Admīrābar hominis ingenium, nec tamen prōram praealtam 
approbābam; ille vērō negat sine hīs rēbus vēla prōfore. Mox 
ingemō, nescius quārē, quōrsum, quandō, in magnum mare sim 
invāsūrus. Sed mēmet objūrgō: Cūr tandem, priusquam hī virī ad 
tē vēnērunt, tū tantopere hanc scapham fōvistī? Agnōscō 
oportēre, in cāsūs necessāriē incertissimōs, scapham quam 
rōbustissimē reconcinnāre, vēlīs idōneam. Itaque dē ferrāriā rē 
etiam atque etiam commeditor, modo chartā dēlīneāns, modo ipsa 
ferrāmenta colligēns, comparāns, exāmināns. 

278. Inter haec libet cum Ēlāpsō caprōrum scopulōs vīsitāre. 
Equidem semper timidus fueram, quotiēs ibi forem, (nam inter 
saxa prōspicere nequībam) nē novum quid atque īnfēstum latēns 
subitō ingrueret. Fateor mē, dum sōlus manēbam, timidiōrem in 
diēs factum. Minus minusque mē in dēnsōs artōsque locōs volēbam 
committere; sed aperta amābam spatia, ubi cūncta longē possem 
prōspectāre: idcircō quoque minus inter saxa caprīna pervāseram. 
Nunc cum Ēlāpsō fortiōrem mē gerēns, cum pistolīs prōdeō: ille 
sīcam gerēbat: explōrāre, nōn vēnārī volō. Ascendimus trāmitem; 
verna prāta flōribus suāveolentia praeterimus; locōs nōtōs 
recognōscō. Mox longius penetrāns, ab excelsiōre quōdam saxō 
repente novum grātissimumque videō prōspectum. Lacus 
longissimus, quasi amnis flexuōsus, per plūra mīllia passuum in 
fronte jacēbat. Aquās quāsdam vīcīnās anteā notāveram; jam 
agnōscō aut membra hujus fuisse lacūs, aut ejus quasi cisternās 
nātūrālēs. In ōrā erant herbae fruticēsque viridissimī, 
ūberrimum mītibus bēstiīs praebentēs alimentum. Circā surgēbant 
acclīvēs scopulī, quibus dēcurrentēs sine numerō rīvulī lacum 
replēbant. Maxima vīs hīc versābātur aquātilium alitum tamquam 
suā in domō. 279. Dum haec mē valdē excitant, Ēlāpsus 
antilopārum gregem vīderat, magnā cum dēlectātiōne: mihi in 
palūdēs aspicientī illud jam succurrit, fortasse hās ejus esse 
generis quod palūstre appellātur. Sed nōlō eās perturbāre, atque 
ad mare potius dūcō, ubi juga montium altius assurgēbant. Lacum 
ā septentriōnibus circumeō, inde pergēns mare versus. Tandem, 
per scopulōs ēnīsī, mare nōn longē vidēmus, sed dēscēnsū 
asperrimō ā nōbīs dīvīsum. Subjacēbat ōra terrae, longula, 
palmīs praesertim abundāns; sed rūpēs ulterius ipsās in undās 
vidēbantur sē praecipitāre. Nūllum sānē portum hāc in ōrā 
dispiciō, quod orientem versus patēbat. Circumversī, sed mare 
dēspicientēs, redīmus domum. 280. Ego vērō, quamquam augēscēbant 
imbrēs, operā ferrāriā identidem exercēbar. Incūdem, follēs, 
malleōs, forcipēs, ē rē tormentāriā nāvis nostrae habēbam. 
Fornācem dē novō, famulīs meīs adjūtus, dēcrēvī exstruere, 
latericiam māteriem residuam adhibēns. Carbōnēs ē lignō parāre 
uterque probē calluit. Mox, Ēlāpsō follēs exercente, ego ac 
Secūtor ferreolōs calefactōs tundēbāmus. Etiam calidum frīgidō 
pertundere docēbam, dum Secūtor forcipem tenet. Sīc virgae 
ferreae, quālēs propter scapham postulābat Ēlāpsus perficiuntur. 
Aliud post aliud paulātim cōnāmur; prīmō multimodīs clāvōs 
ferreōs mūtābāmus,—in hāmōs, in ānulōs, mox in spīcātōs ānulōs; 
sīc plūrēs in fōrmās discēbāmus ferrum fingere. Tandem illī, rē 
tōtā perspectā, significant, meō labōre nōn jam esse opus: sē 
hujus artificiī esse compotēs. 281. Inter haec, magnō sum dolōre 
afflīctus, occīsō psittacō. Hunc accipiter quīdam incautum 
excēpit, neque ego ulcīscī poteram, quamquam strepitum 
cārissimae avis audiēns. Sed antequam ignipultam attinērem, 
hostis cum praedā ēvānuit. Hanc sānē rem aegerrimē tulī. Quod 
postquam animadvertit Ēlāpsus, sōlārī mē volēns, psittacōs nōn 
bonās esse avēs dīcit, aliās quāsdam longē meliōrēs; neque 
dolendum esse, quandō tanta mihi superesset avium pulcherrimārum 
atque ūtilissimārum varietās, quae velut caprae aut columbae 
cibātum ab homine accipere vellent. Tunc meminī, eum tāle quid 
dē phāsiānīs illīs dīxisse; mox interrogandō comperiō, ipsās hās 
avēs facile mānsuēscere et ōva parere plūrima: id quod libenter 
audiō. Tum Secūtōrī dēnūntiō, sī aliquot hārum avium possit 
īnsidiīs capere vīvās, id mihi fore grātissimum. 

282. Plūrima per imbrēs parābāmus. Catapultās in diēs perfectius 
figūrābant: lōrīcam ego et ālās scaphae summā cūrā mātūrābam. 
Scīlicet Ēlāpsus bitūmine quōdam opus suum perūnxerat, ut aquam 
rejicerent juncī cannaeque: ā mē postulābat ut compāgem tōtam 
firmiter conjungerem. Alia quaedam in melius novābam, quae 
longum est dīcere:—dē supellectile tractōriā, item dē arcīs 
penāriīs. Famulī autem meī operās quāsdam inter sē exercēbant, 
dē quibus nōn cōnsulēbar. Id mē nōn conturbat, quoniam 
industriōs sentiō. Inter imbrēs pābula vel ligna colligunt, 
folia, cannās, alia reportant, fimum humō ingerunt, gregī 
īnserviunt, natant, rēmigant, gladiō vel tēlīs sē exercent. Sīc 
diēs praetereunt celeriter. 283. Jam Secūtor ad mē venit, 
venerānsque humiliter ait, “Pessimōs esse leporēs: velle sē 
occīdere.” Dioscōreās et maniocās ostendit, nōn corrōsās modo, 
sed ex humō ēvulsās. Leporēs sī suprā sint, “bonōs” esse ait, 
sed “īnfrā nōn bonōs.” Etsī parum bene loquēbātur, intellegō 
quid velit, et videō nōn esse absonum. Attamen vexāre mītissimam 
gentem, quam egomet tamquam colōnōs dēdūxeram, id nimis crūdēle 
putō. Tandem, multum reluctātus, ēscā atque blanditiīs veterēs 
mānsuētōsque parentēs capiō, et in prīstinam caveam conclūdō. 
Cēterōs ad arbitrum Secūtōris abigī aut occīdī patior. 284. 
Duōrum jam ministrōrum operā adjūtus, paulō amplius poteram 
litterīs mē dare: id vērō ipsum illī mīrābantur. Aliquandō 
quāsdam rēs iīs ē librō legēbam, sī quid possent intellegere: 
post paulō id eōs penetrābat altius. Nempe vidēbant, sibi esse 
aut suam aut senum aliquot ⸤quibuscum vīxissent⸥ sapientiam; mē 
ex librō plūrimōrum cognitiōnēs ad libitum meum haurīre. 285. 
Quoniam neque librōrum habuī cōpiam, neque ōtium iīs esse 
poterat, litterās docēre supervacāneum crēdidī; sed līberē 
colloquēbar multīs dē rēbus. Illī autem, arrēctīs animīs, 
studiōsē auscultābant. Dē meīs fortūnīs aliquot rēs ēnārrāvī, 
dēnique dē naufragiō. Magnitūdinem dēmōnstrāvī nāvis et ūberem 
rērum cōpiam, quam ex merīs ruīnīs excēpī. Tālia dum nārrābam, 
illī textilia continuābant opera et linguae meae in diēs fīēbant 
intellegentiōrēs: id quod maximī sānē erat mōmentī. 

286. Tandem sē aperiunt, explicantque quidnam ēlabōrāverint. 
Rēgium mihi vestītum exhibent atque impōnunt. Prīmum erat 
capitis decorāmen, crista vel corōna ex pennīs multicolōribus: 
hanc īnfulae meae superimpositum volēbant. Dein teges dorsuālis 
ex palmeīs cannīs atque arundinibus; quae sīc erant dispositae, 
ut ipsārum colōrēs prō pulcherrimō fuerint ōrnāmentō. 
Praecīnctōrium item erat ex mollibus juncīs, quod ā ventre ad 
genū pertingēbat. Tum calceī, ex palmārum fūne suprā, ex cocōrum 
villō īnfrā. Ē bullīs vitreīs catellās fēcerant, collārem 
tālāremque: porrō aliās bullās aut vestī aut praecīnctōriō 
assuerant, tamquam gemmās. Tālia fidēlitātis documenta 
laetissimē et benignissimē accēpī: sēnsī profectō, posse 
barbarica rēgnī īnsignia multum valēre, aut apud hōs ipsōs, aut 
apud aliōs barbarōs. Dēcernō quotīdiē, fīnītīs operibus, ūnō 
alterōve hōrum mē ōrnāre; et sī quā diēs sōlemnior vidērētur, 
gestāre ūniversa. Nunc, benignitātis ostentuī, utrumque fidēlium 
ministrōrum super oculīs ōsculor. 287. Longum foret sī nārrārem, 
quantā cum industriā messem frūctuum, rādīcum ac foliōrum suā in 
tempestāte collēgerīmus, trēs virī cum tribus jūmentīs. Ego 
autem post biennium hāc in īnsulā jam factus sum temporum 
perītior: sī vērō anteā ego nimium fuī avidus, hī nunc meam 
aviditātem superant. Nec culpō, immō laudō et grātiās agō, quod 
tam labōriōsē vīctum et dēliciās comparent. Pluviae, calōrēs, 
procellae, fulgura, suō in ōrdine, velut annō superiōre rediēre. 
Dēmum, tempestāte illā perāctā, caelī serēnitās rediit; atque 
illī sub aurōram labōrantēs, scapham perficiēbant praesaeptam 
labrōsamque. Dein post autumnālēs procellās prōrsus fīnītās, ut 
ipsō in marī probārētur opus, ērēctī sunt omnium animī. Vēlīs 
accūrātissimē recognitīs, variās cursūs experīmur fōrmās. Prō 
saburrā ⸤ponderōsa aliquot saxa⸥ portābāmus; haec cum ipsā 
ancorā ita collocāvimus, ut scapham male dēprimerent; quae 
nihilōminus sē solidam stabilemque praestitit. In portum 
regressī, novam lōrīcam explōrāmus, num quā laxētur vel 
firmitāte careat. Sānē plauditur ab ūniversīs. 288. Postrīdiē 
cōram mē submissē veniunt, dīcuntque, “esse quod velint ōrāre: 
spērāre sē, benignē mē audītūrum.” Impetrātā veniā, līberē 
curtēque explicant, “sine uxōribus vītam nōn bene trānsigī: 
velle sē in scaphā uxōrēs ex adversā terrā reportāre.” Id mē 
sānē perculit: tot rēs in mentem irruēbant; vultusque meus, ut 
crēdō, retegēbat, quid sentīrem. Breviter ajō: “omnī in rē mē 
illīs cōnsultum velle; sī possim, factūrum; sed multa esse 
perpendenda, nec posse mē illicō respōnsum dare. Ad mūnia sua 
redīrent, crēderentque mē dē suō commodō ānxiē meditārī.” 289. 
Dē mōbilitāte et perfidiā barbarōrum multa audīveram. Mēmet 
interrogābam, anne idcircō rēgiīs mē honōribus cumulāverint, ut 
scapham fūrātī abīrent. Id vērō posse negō; hī namque virī fuēre 
hostēs: uterque ad mē quam ad alterum propior est. Tum sī 
aufugere velint, Quamne ad terram? anne ad patriam? sed patriae 
sunt dīversae. Sed sint sānē fidēlēs: mēne scapham meam cum meīs 
ministrīs marī committere, domī sedentem? quī sī flūctibus 
haustī numquam redeant, iterum sum orbātus, et pejus quoque, spē 
abruptā. Melius arbitror perīcula participāre. At sī omnēs 
ēgredimur, quis gregem cūstōdiet? quis frūgēs dēcerpet, 
servābit? Tālia commeditātus, crāstinō diē iterum colloquor. 
290. Prīmum interrogō, Anne jam uxōrēs habeant. Secūtor 
abruptius respondet: “per mē suam uxōrem ā sē distractam:” 
fuscus autem rubor, dum loquēbātur, vultum oculōsque implēbat, 
in quō tenerum aliquid inesse putābam. “Mortuum esse sē uxōrī 
suae,” addidit; “quae, secundum gentis mōrem, jam aliī virō sine 
dubiō nūpsisset; quoniam, sē vīvere, nēmō suōrum posset 
crēdere.” Rēctē eum dīcere jūdicābam. Mox Ēlāpsus ūmēscente 
oculō incertāque linguā respondet, “sibi virginem quandam fuisse 
dēspōnsam, quandō ab hostibus surreptus esset.” Nihil ultrā 
addidit. 291. Deinde interrogō, unde velint uxōrēs petere? ab 
Ēlāpsī patriā an ā Secūtōris? et quō signō cursum in marī 
possint dīrigere? Respondet Ēlāpsus, “Secūtōrem ad ipsīus 
patriam nōlle revertī: id uxōrī ejus fore crūdēlissimum: Ēlāpsī 
patriam ambō petītūrōs. Cēterum sī ventō favente hanc īnsulam 
ipsā vesperā relinquant, cum lūce terram continentem propius 
vīsūrum, cūnctam sibi satis nōtam; deinde, ut prīmum populāribus 
suīs aspiciantur, hīs approbantibus ad terram appulsūrōs.” Tālia 
quum audīssem, respondī: Rēctē sē rēs habēre; sed amplius esse 
ponderandās. 

292. Vespere post operam, ad rem redeō, interrogāns: “Quis autem 
tot buccīs cibum dabit, sī hāc in īnsulā quīnque erimus,—trēs 
virī, uxōrēs duae?” Tum Secūtor arrīdēns ait, “Octo hominibus 
satis esse jam cibī, superque.” Ēlāpsus autem, genibus meīs 
prōvolūtus, dextram ōsculātur, ōratque, “nē īrāscar; sed amplius 
quiddam illōs in animō habēre. Interrogantī mihi, Quidnam 
igitur?” respondet: Mātrem suam esse mortuam, frātrēs occīsōs: 
velle sē, sī possit id fierī, patrem suum hūc trānsvehere. Hoc 
quum dīxisset, vultum meum sollicitē contemplāns, addit: “Numne 
aliud quiddam audeam dīcere?” “Perge:” inquam. Tum dīcit, 
“Nescīre sē, quis sit uxōrem datūrus: posse autem fierī, ut 
parēns, quī ūnam habeat virginem fīliam ita velit dare, sī cum 
eā sit itūrus. Anne ego nōlim īnsulam meam frequentārī?” Rēs 
ipsa nōn mihi displicēbat: quamquam id quoque reputō, cavendum 
esse, nē nimiā barbarōrum frequentiā ipse in servitūtem redigar. 
Ergō benignē respondeō, dē tot novīs rēbus cōnsīderātē 
cōgitandum. Illud tantum affirmō, sī proficīscentur, mē socium 
perīculī habitūrōs. 

293. Postrīdiē iīs annūntiō, grātissimum esse id mihi, quod tam 
longē prōspexerint tamque industriē labōrāverint, praeparantēs 
cibum, īnstrūmenta, māteriem, ipsamque scapham. Tālibus virīs, 
quidquid restet arduī, spērāre mē fore prōnum; sed priusquam 
aliīs dē rēbus dīcam, illud apprīmē necessārium, ut nostram nōs 
īnsulam explōrēmus, antequam in cāsūs maris committāmur. Hoc 
enim stāre mihi certum, ut nōn sine mē nāvigent. Jam sī procella 
ingruet, sī vī ventī in aliud īnsulae latus dētrūdāmur, quid 
ignāvius, quam nōn nōsse portūs, lītora, rīvōs, ubi tūtō 
recondāmur? Circumnāvigandam īnsulam, indāgandās prōfluentēs 
maris, tentandās bolide profunditātēs, notandās in chartā 
montium fōrmās, priusquam in incerta maris ruāmus. Haec quum 
dīxissem, illī prīmō vix intellegēbant; sed postquam bis terque 
explicāvī, tandem aequissimīs animīs dēcrētum meum accēpērunt. 



CAPUT (XI.) ŪNDECIMUM. 


294. Post hōs sermōnēs uterque magis magisque in operās ruit. 
Vestītūs nūptiālēs ac dōna spōnsālia crēdēbam praeparārī. 
Cannārum, arundinum, juncōrum, restium vel fīlōrum, pinnārum 
plūmārumque magnam vim comportābant. Posteā explicātur, patriō 
Ēlāpsī rēgulō plūmātam vestem ac dorsuālem tegetem prō dōnō 
dēstinārī. Id quum intellēxī, ē vitreīs meīs bullīs plūrēs 
obtulī, ut prō torque collārī essent: hās accēpit Ēlāpsus 
libentissimē. Videō quoque lectōrum opercula vel strāgula ē 
mollibus juncīs contexī: igitur versicolōrēs vestēs ⸤quās 
habēbam fulgentissimās⸥ in spōnsārum ūsum dōnō. 295. Ego vērō 
bolide (quam Graecī vocant) quaesītā;—etenim plūrēs in nāve 
fuerant—saepius cum alterutrō virōrum ēgrediēbar longius, 
interdum in cymbā, sī valdē esset serēna tempestās, quia tum 
rēmīs certior est cursus. Tunc tōtam illam ōram quae Caprīnō 
Jugō subjacet, satis explōrāvī; nusquam patēbat scaphae 
receptāculum: sed collēs accūrātē dēlīneāvī, ut locōs posthāc 
recognōscerem. Necnōn cum ambōbus in scaphā ēgressus, ōram 
adversam juxtā hortōs ulterius vīsitāvī; quidquid dē lītore, dē 
profunditāte, dē montibus erat notandum, id cōnscrīpsī, notātīs 
caelī regiōnibus. Necnōn ūnīcuique montium nōmen indidī aliquod, 
cum suā figūrā dēscrīptum. 296. Quum diē quōdam in hortīs cum 
Ēlāpsō permānsī, Secūtōre domum missō propter variōs ūsūs, per 
īnferiōra prāta dīligentius exspatiantēs, orȳzam invēnimus in 
ūvidiōre locō lātē crēscentem, ubi numquam anteā incesseram. 
Hanc rem crēdidī posse aliquandō magnī esse mōmentī. 297. 
Postrīdiē quiēscente aurā, excurrimus in cymbā usque ad portum 
hortōrum. Montem illum altissimum jūdicō praecipuum esse 
oportēre locōrum documentum. Quārē ā tribus lateribus figūram 
ejus accūrātē dēlīneō; tum crēdidī, mē, sī hāc in parte īnsulae 
forem, in diē quamvīs nūbilō positūram meam agnitūrum. Cautēs 
quoque, sī quās vidērem, scrīptō notāvī. 298. Prōfluentēs maris 
multō erat difficilius observāre vel conjectāre; nam aestus 
diurnus atque aura conturbābat ratiōnēs meās. Īnsulam ā 
Septemtriōnibus praevertī nōn ausus sum. Multa nāvigandō 
expertus, tandem dēspērō dē prōfluentibus cognōscendīs, nec 
valdē perturbor, sed dē hāc rē reticuī. 

299. Domum revertentī dēlicātissimum mihi prandium appōnit 
Secūtor, ex avibus grandiōribus membrātim concīsīs. Genus avium 
nesciēbam: num ōtidēs[W] esse possint, dubitābam. Ille explicat, 
esse eās ex hōc genere, quod mānsuēfactum volēbam; sed hāctenus 
nūllam sē cēpisse vīvam. Neque ille neque Ēlāpsus vult vēscī: 
sed postquam fīnīvī, vēscēbantur. Tum interrogō, quidnam dē 
grege possit fierī, sī nōs omnēs peregrīnāmur. Tacent paulisper; 
mox Ēlāpsus respondet: “Sī faveant aurae atque Fortūna 
Marītālis, trīduō nōs posse revertī. Solvendum esse gregem, 
compedibus fortasse vel objicibus praepedītum. Quandō redeāmus, 
fistulae cantuī oboedītūrōs: sīn minus, sī forte haedōrum 
aliquot āmittantur, ferendum damnum. Nōs ē colle Caprīnō novōs 
haedōs, sī libeat, vēnārī posse; uxōrēs nōn posse.” Quandō haec 
sēriō ac dēlīberātissimē dīxit, vix rīsum continuī. 300. Sed 
pergō interrogāre, Quot rēmōs habeāmus scaphae. “Duōs tantum,” 
respondent; eōs nempe quōs egomet fabricāvī. Id sufficere negō; 
quippe sī aurā dēficiāmur, fortasse rēmigantēs trēs virī 
quattuor rēmīs novum assequēmur ventum, sed duōbus ūtentēs rēmīs 
in stāgnante āere haerēbimus. Novōs rēmōs, clāmant, caedendōs; 
id quod ego comprobō. 301. Tum alium injiciō scrūpulum. Sī 
barbarīs foret cōnflīgendum, ego ignipultā pistolīsque valeō; 
ministrī meī cōminus gladiō bene pugnant, sed ēminus ā barbarīs 
superantur. Nam neque multās habent sagittās, neque multum in 
hāc arte sunt exercitī: porrō sī maximē essent sagittāriī, duo 
virī ā multīs facile obruuntur. Meliōribus opus est tēlīs,—Hīc 
pausam faciō. 302. Illī prīmō tacuēre: tandem invītō sermōnem. 
Ēlāpsus timidē interrogat, “anne sciam, quot habeāmus in ūsum 
catapultārum praeparāta spīcula missilia?” Tum respondeō, “Ego 
certē nesciō.” Ille vērō, tamquam veritus nē mē reprehēnsiōne 
corripiat, tacet iterum. Sed Secūtor, paulō audentior, testātur, 
“nōn posse illōs portāre spīculōrum jam cōnfictōrum pondus: 
plūra cōnfingere, inūtile esse: quod genus tēlōrum sit melius, 
sē nescīre, nisi sī ignipultās dēnotāre velim.” 303. Sēnsī mē 
errāsse; nam nōluī igniāria tēla tunc eōs ēdocēre. Itaque 
benignē dīxī, “industriam illōrum omnī laude esse dignam, mēque 
gaudēre, quod tantam habērent spīculōrum vim: spērāre mē, sine 
proeliō aut jūrgiō nōs reditūrōs; sed quotīdiē catapultās 
exercērent, et tot uterque sēcum assūmeret spīcula, quot rēs 
ipsa permitteret.” Tālī respōnsō contentōs sē dēmōnstrābant. 

304. Caesīs duōbus cocōrum truncīs, dissecāmus, dolāmus, in 
rēmōs fingimus;—nam quattuor rēmōs placēbat cōnficere. Variātā 
operā ac lūdō, in labōrēs reficimur, aemulātiōne ac spē ērēctī. 
Haec inter negōtia multum colloquimur. Dē ipsōrum patriā 
interrogō virōs, numne eārumdem rērum sit ferāx, quae hāc in 
īnsulā gignuntur. 305. Illī explicant, paene contiguās sē 
habitāsse regiōnēs, scopulōsā ōrā dīvīsās, quae ⸤ipsōs propter 
scopulōs⸥ ab utrīsque concupīscerētur; hinc illōs internecīnīs 
involvī bellīs. Nam cēteram suōrum terram ex merā humō 
cōnsistere, mollī, ūvidā, arboribus fruticibusque ūberrimā, sed 
siccīs solidīsque locīs carente: porrō per inopiam ferrī optimum 
lignum minus esse ūtile; igitur saxō dēstitūtīs nūlla esse 
domōrum fundāmenta. 306. Domōs gentīliciās, ut plūrimum, nīdōs 
esse, inter rāmōs arborum contextās, ut ab ūdō solō 
submoveantur, praesertim tumēscentibus fluviīs. In ūvidā 
calidāque illā humō prōcērās nāscī arborēs, ēgregiōs frūctūs; 
plūra tamen genera meīs in montibus vigēre, quae illīc ūvidus 
calor nōn patiātur. Interrogō, Habeantne ūvās? “Habēbāmus,” 
inquit Secūtor, “sed gustū hīs disparēs: nīl erant nostrae, nisi 
dulcis quaedam in ōre aqua.” “Ergō,” inquam, “tū exquīre, 
quidnam ē siccātis nostrīs ūvīs sit optimum, quod patrī spōnsae 
tuae dēs dōnō.” Arrīdet. 307. Tum in Ēlāpsum conversus: “Tuāne 
in patriā nūptiās tum celeriter perficiunt, ut parēns tribus 
hōrīs ūnicam fīliam virō ignōtō forās dūcendam trādat?” Paulum 
pudibundus respondet ille: “Sī pater domī relinquendus erit, nōn 
potest id fierī: sīn pater cum fīliā sit itūrus, potest 
nōnnumquam. Atquī neque ego inter meōs sum ignōtus, et propter 
mē cōnfīdent Secūtōrī. Tē autem rēgiē vestītum postquam vīderint 
ac vim tēlōrum nōverint, audierintque ā mē quālis et quantus 
sīs, quidlibet mihi tuī grātiā concēdent.” Dubitābam, merane 
esset hoc adūlātiō, an vēritās; vēra tamen eum dīcere, libēbat 
crēdere. 308. Mox ē Secūtōre quaerēbam, quāpropter ipse atquī 
ipsīus populārēs ad īnsulam meam tunc pervēnerint et numquam 
aliās. Rem ab initiō nārrat. Scopulōsa illa regiō erat ab 
alterīs occupāta: hinc coeptum est bellum. Quisquis hostium erat 
in praesidiō, comedendus dēstinābātur: id gravissimum iīs 
supplicium. Inter aliōs correptus est illīc Ēlāpsus. Sed patriam 
versus redeuntēs oppressit procella, quae duās scaphās in 
apertum mare abripuit. Tōtam noctem frūstrā luctātī, summō māne 
īnsulam meam nōn longē vīdērunt. Volentēs neque vēnēre neque 
iterum venient; nam igneī meī tēlī vīs prō fulgure 
praestigiātōris dīvīnī sine dubiō nūntiātur. 309. Tum volō 
scīre, utrum hīc esse īnsulam prōrsus nescīverint. Tum Ēlāpsus 
cōnfirmat, montem īnsulae excelsissimum interdum distinguī; sed 
nōn vacāre ut merā cūriōsitāte marī sē committant,—tumidō, an 
tranquillō. Percontor, numne carō hūmāna propter libīdinem 
palātī exquīrātur. Ambō vehementer negant: in ultiōnem summae 
injūriae, idcircō tantum ajunt quasi religiōsē comedī. 310. Mox 
Secūtor urget, ut disertē dīcam quō diē velim nāvigāre; nam 
certum sē habēre, benigna mea verba prō factīs valēre, nec velle 
mē sine causā diem prōferre. Tum videō dēcernendum esse sine 
ignāviā dīverticulōrum. Respondeō, sī cūncta parāta sint, intrā 
trīduum nōs profectūrōs. Rūrsus interrogat, anne velim eum 
omnia, quae victūs causā sunt commoda, praeparāre: ego autem 
assentior. 311. Crāstinō diē, dum aliīs in rēbus absum, Secūtor 
haedum jugulat, sanguinem in agellō suō diffundit, cornua 
reservat, membra discerpit; alia coquit, alia suspendit in fūmō. 
Ungulās Ēlāpsus prō glūtine arripit, pellemque incipit patriō 
mōre depsere. Haec rediēns inveniō obviam; sed neque probō neque 
culpō, quoniam veniam meam praeripuerat Secūtor. 312. Ad Ēlāpsus 
conversus quaerō, anne suā in patriā tālēs sint caprī, sīve 
aliārum pellium abundantia. Respondet, apud suōs abundāre 
ursulōs, porcillōs, immō porcōs variī generis, macacōs, sciūrōs, 
et quadrupedēs caprīs meīs parēs, paene aquāticōs; ex quibus 
pellēs dīversās habeant; porrō formīdandōs sed rārōs pardōs, 
quōrum pellis optima sānē: item audīsse sē, longē inter 
scopulōsōs collēs caprōs ferē hujusmodī existere: sē numquam 
vīdisse.—Libet mē tālia scīscitārī et colloquī. 

313. Post bīduum mihi nūntiant, parāta omnia: occidente sōle 
nāvigandum. Hic nūntius mē quasi stupōre dēfīxit; nam mīlle rēs 
prius vidēbantur cōnficiendae. Sed videō mē multa imperāsse: 
nunc dictō oboediendum: ergō dē bellicō apparātū prīmum satagō, 
postpositīs rēbus cēterīs. 314. Mox reperiō Secūtōrem leporēs 
meōs occīdisse, coxisse, sub crustulā condidisse. Vultū angōrem 
dēmōnstrō: sed ille, mē commōtum sentiēns, humī cōnsīdit 
tacitus, reprehēnsiōnem (crēdō) expectāns. Dēmum frāctā vōce 
ait: “Paenitet mē, sīquid tē, ere, laesī.” Tum suspīrāns dīxī, 
“Mūtārī nōn potest: fortasse nōn male fēcistī: cēterum nē canem 
meum occīdās. Ego vērō tibi ignōscō.” 315. Nē longus sim, ferē 
Nōnīs Novembribus, sub noctem nāvigāmus, nunc rēmīs, nunc aurā 
adjūtī. Astrīs facile dīrigēbātur cursus ad merīdiem. Quum ventō 
tranquillē ferēbāmur, quiētī mē dedī, jubēns, sī quid mūtārētur, 
expergēfacere. Ante lūcem stāgnāvit aura; tunc ēvigilō; jubeō 
rēmigāre. 316. Ortō mox sōle, Ēlāpsus grūmōs patriōs procul 
agnōscit: uterque maestior vidēbātur: susurrābant inter sē. Sed 
Ēlāpsum dormīre jubeō: ego cum Secūtōre prōpellō scapham. Post 
hōrulam videō Ēlāpsum propter inquiētam mentem nōn posse 
dormīre; itaque Secūtōrī imperō somnum. Quandō intrā cōnspectum 
venīmus, Ēlāpsus in mālō ērigit signum, apertāque arcā, rēgiīs 
vestibus mē exōrnat. Tum extractō cibō vēscī hortātur. Secūtor 
mox ēvigilat, et vēscimur omnēs, cane nōn invītō. 317. Jam 
linter ā terrā cautius appropinquat: trēs inerant virī: crēdō, 
quia nōs erant trēs. “Quid autem tē tuī cīvēs vocant?” Ēlāpsum 
interrogō. “Ego apud eōs” inquit, “sum Gelavi.” “Dehinc ergō 
apud mē eris Gelavius,” inquam. “Ego vērō apud meōs eram Totopil,
” īnfit Secūtor. “Ergō tū,” inquam, “eris Totopillus.” Dum rīsū 
et alloquiō oblectāmur, accesserat linter: mox noster Gelavius 
nesciō quid clārā vōce prōnūntiat. Illī gestientēs strepunt, 
proximē accēdunt, mē mīrābundī aspectant. Postquam iterum 
perōrāvit Gelavius, illī rapidē ad terram rēmigant, nōs sequimur 
tardiusculē. Tandem, jubente Gelaviō, ancoram jacimus: mē virī 
meī, honōris causā, umerīs suīs in lītus dēportant. Strātīs 
tapētibus, cōnsīdō: sēricam meam umbellam Totopillus super mē 
praetendit; Gelavius ēvānuerat. 318. Opperīmur reditum ejus. 
Redit dēmum cum catervā magnā. In fronte erat ipse, cum seniōre 
virō et virgine. Tum mē compellāns ait, “Ēn pater meus! Ēn ūnica 
soror!” Pater genua mea manūsque fervidē ōsculātus est, virgō 
quasi venerāns cōnstitit. Mox Gelavius cum Totopillō verba 
sēcrētō habet, post quae intimōs crēdidī sermōnēs miscērī. 
Intereā tōta nōbīs caterva circumfunditur, mox ad scapham sē 
convertit. Id mē aliquantum commovet. Gelavius autem multās rēs, 
dōna prīncipī, effert; dein ignipultās meās cum sacculīs 
subsidiāriīs: mox Totopillum videō scūtulum prō mētā ērēxisse. 

319. Quīnque juvenēs cum arcubus astābant. Ā vīgintī passibus 
sagittās ad scūtulum dīrēxēre; nēmō medium ferit, nēmō per 
tabulam penetrat. Deinde Gelavius et Totopillus ā trīgintā 
passibus ē catapultīs jaculantur. Hī et jūstius collīneābant, et 
altius penetrābant: facile erant victōrēs. Posteā ad mē venerāns 
accēdit caterva, ōrāns ut ignipultae ostentem vim: tum multō cum 
honōre ad carcer dūcunt. Quīnquāgintā passūs mētārī jubeō: 
bitubam meam suā cum furcā comportāveram. Dēmissō genū, bis 
ignem ējiciō: utraque glāns medium trānsverberat scūtulum. 
Ejulābant territī, mox murmure collaudābant: deinde magnum erat 
silentium. Gelavius tunc cūnctīs explicat, hīs tēlīs sē per mē 
fuisse servātum. 320. Inter haec Gelaviī pater cum fīliā cōram 
mē redit, Totopillus autem prō interprete mihi explicat, velle 
illum sē suamque fīliam fideī atque īnsulae meae committī. Tum 
ego abruptius Totopillō, “Egone hanc prō tuā uxōre mēcum 
reportābō?” Is autem ērubēscēns annuit: “Ere! reportābis sānē, 
sī libet, et uxōrem meam et patrem uxōris.” “At vērō,” inquam, 
“prīncipī oportet mē obviam venīre honōris causā, nec tamquam 
clanculum abīre.” Respondet Totopillus, “Immō, id prīncipī foret 
ingrātum. Ille neque tibi vult offēnsam afferre, neque nimiō 
ergā tē honōre sē suīs ēlevāre.[X] Sed dōnīs Gelaviī plācātus, 
honōrificam cōram multitūdine dē tē fēcit mentiōnem.” 321. 
Jamque accurrit Gelavius, excitātus ut numquam vīderam. Hic 
sēcum habēbat virum ac mulierem cum virgine. Mē rēctā petit, et 
rem omnem aperit. “Ellam! quae mihi erat dēspōnsa. Propter meī 
amōrem nōndum voluit nūbere: ēn pater māterque ejus! Tūne nōlis, 
Ō ere! hanc meam familiam mēcum revehere? Omnēs sunt tuī 
cupidissimī.” “Ego sānē volō,” inquam: “sed quot post hōrās?” 
“Jam sunt parātī,” respondet: “ad tenuem comportandam 
supellectilem vix sēmihōrā opus est.” 322. Fateor, haec mihi 
nimia erant: velut in somniō esse vidēbar. Tandem ministrīs meīs 
dīcō: “Quod bene vortat Deus, ex intimō pectore grātulor vōbīs. 
Nunc, nē tempestās sē mūtet, quam celerrimē redeāmus.” Illī cum 
seniōribus colloquuntur; tandem renūntiant, tribus post merīdiem 
hōrīs esse nāvigandum. Id admīrāns, ajō nōn posse fierī. “Immō,” 
ajunt: “sīc erit melius, ipsō tē jūdice.” 

323. Videō aliās aliāsque accēdere lintrēs, et multa inter sē 
parāre. Praestitūtā hōrā scapham ingredimur, quīnque virī, ūna 
mulier, duae virginēs, cum cane optimō, quem puerī valdē mīrātī 
sunt. Hospitum ūnusquisque spississimās suās vestēs indūtus est: 
strāgulās quoque in scaphā composuerant. Aura paulum erat 
adversa; sed octo lintrēs cum rōbustīs rēmigibus nōs fūne 
trahēbant, tribus hōrīs amplius. Simul ut Auster ventus flābat, 
Gelavius, multīs āctīs grātiīs, bonōs rēmigēs valēre jubet, 
mūnusculō quoque ūnumquemque prōrētam honōrat, sed tantā rēs 
trādidit celeritāte, ut, quid dederit, nesciam scrībere. 324. 
Excussō remulcō, vēlīs nāvigāmus. Gelavius clāvum tenet. Illud 
tantum nārrābō, mē propter concitātiōnem mentis nōn potuisse 
dormīre; Gelavium, quī prius nōn potuit, post aliquot hōrās 
dormīvisse optimē. Jūcundissimam sēnsī noctis auram, et dē 
futūrō meditābar, nōn sine precibus ac grātiīs Deō oblātīs. 325. 
Prīmā cum lūcē ⸤montis nostrī figūram⸥ agnōscō. Tandem Austrō 
cessante, Subsōlānus ventus surgit vehementior, torquetque nōs 
nimium ad sinistram. Equidem nōlēbam tam pretiōsum onus vel 
minimō perīculō committere: igitur, quoniam nēmō omnium erat 
invalidus, in hortōrum portum dīrēxī cursum. Ibi sūmptō mātūtīnō 
cibō, scapham Gelaviō commīsī, cum patre, quandō faveat ventus, 
circumdūcendam: ego cum cēterīs domum revertor, collēs 
ēscendēns. Nōs ante merīdiem cavernās assequimur: illī sērius 
perveniunt. 326. Summam autem rūpem dum pervādimus, fistulā 
canendō recolligō gregem. Dēsunt duo tantum ē jūniōribus. Hōs 
crāstinō diē Totopillus ācerrimē anquīsītōs recuperat, cane 
adjūtōre. Sīc illa rēs faustum habuit exitum.



CAPUT (XII.) DUODECIMUM.


327. Nōmina novae familiae hīc libet nārrāre. Gelaviī pater erat 
Pachus, soror Laris. Spōnsa autem Gelaviī Fenis appellābātur; 
hujus parentēs Calefus et Upis. Upim crēdidī vix amplius 
quadrāgintā quattuor habēre annōs, et neque Pachum neque Calefum 
exsuperāre quīnquāgintā. Bīduum praeparandīs nūptiīs 
dēstinantur; quae quidem omnia ipsīs relinquō. Nūntiō tamen 
parentibus per interpretēs meōs,—sī quid vestis apud mē sit, 
quod ūtendum velint sūmere propter fīliās suās, vel sī quae dē 
cavernīs videantur prō cubiculīs commodae, nē graventur quidvīs 
mē rogāre. 

328. Inter haec maximō cum gaudiō accurrit Totopillus, 
nūntiatque sē ālitēs trēs, ex eō genere quod posset mānsuēscere, 
cēpisse vīvōs. Atquī nōn erant phāsiānī, neque, quantum ego 
poteram intellegere, ōtidēs; sed nostrātium gallōs gallīnāsque 
potius referēbant, quamquam longē erant grandiōrēs 
augustiōrēsque, ac sānē splendidī. Equidem Gallum Indicum prō 
nōmine indidī. Libenter crēdēbam, hoc avium genus numerō ōvōrum 
apprīmē excellere: tum mānsuēfacienda dēcernō. Mās ūnus erat, 
duae fēminae: nesciēbam, anne parēs numerō conjugēs esse 
dēbērent: sed Totopillō imperāvī, asservāret omnēs summā cum 
sēdulitāte, daretque operam, ut prōlēs gignerētur plūrima ac 
mānsuēta. Ipsum erat genus alitum, quod ōlim mihi Gelavius 
dēnotāverat. 329. Quandō autem frūctuārium meum intrō, fūrēs ibi 
videō rēs dēspoliāsse. Cocōrum aliquot nucēs, sacculō quōdam 
discissō, abreptae fuerant: id sine dubiō macacōrum erat opus. 
Atque anteā, mē absente, ūnam nucem surripuerat macacus, neque, 
quī rem vīdit Totopillus, poterat prohibēre. Aliās rēs mīrē 
disjectās suīs ē locīs invenīmus: fēlēs inculpat Totopillus. 
Equidem nōn crēdō: sed ille urget vehementer, petitque ut liceat 
ūnam reservāre fēlem cum pusillō mare, cēterās abigere: ego 
vērō, nē nimium adversārer, tandem permīsī. 

330. Explōrātīs cavernīs, trēs prō conjugālibus cubiculīs 
dēstinantur: sed quoniam opera quaedam prius vidēbantur 
necessāria, meō ipsīus cubiculō cēdō. Hoc atque mūsēum novīs 
nūptīs permittō, frūctuārium Calefō et Upī: ego in armāmentāriō 
dormiō. Nūptiās suō ferē in mōre trānsigunt: sed postquam 
uterque pater spōnsum spōnsam suam ōsculārī jussit, (id quod 
sōlemnēs caerimōniās mihi vidēbātur termināre,) ego, indūtus 
rēgium vestītum, perōrātūrus assurrēxī, jussīque Gelavium 
interpretārī. 331. Dīxī mē, Deī nōmine, in meam eōs īnsulam 
convēxisse, ut forent beātī, mē regente: cēterum obsequentiam 
postulō: jamque imprīmīs, mea lingua est ab omnibus perdiscenda, 
et quantum fierī potest, semper dehinc hāc in īnsulā audiētur.—
Tum Gelaviō et Totopillō imperō, ut prandium nūptiāle appōnātur. 
Post prandium, in rūpem ambulābant, mīrantēs īnsulam. Vespere, 
obortīs tenebrīs, ē corruptō pulvere nitrātō aliquot ego 
pyrobolōs cremāvī, gestientibus barbarīs. Sīc cōnfectae sunt 
nūptiae. 

332. Jam ego Upī mātrēs antilopās, ā cane vigilanter cūstōdītās, 
dēmōnstrāveram, et dē mulgendī arte cōnātus eram explicāre. Ea 
cūram lactāriam ācerrimē suscipit: duae autem erant mātrēs cum 
haediculīs, nec multum sānē expectābam lactis, quamquam corpore 
erant grandiōrēs. Eadem cassāvam pānem ex maniocā et tapiocam 
optimē cōnficiēbat. Mox Calefus pollicētur nova vāsa fictilia, 
ac meliōra quidem, sē factūrum; atque ego dē cāseō, dē būtȳrō, 
dē lactis flōre, quidquid nōveram, per Totopillum commūnicō, sed 
cāseum praesertim cēnseō faciendum. Item plumbum liquefactum, ad 
vitream vāsōrum superficiem quantum cōnferat, dēmōnstrō.. 333. 
Pachus īnstrūmenta agrī colendī atque omnem rem ferrāriam 
vehementer admīrātur: mox per Gelavium ēdoctus, prīnceps ēvādit 
faber ferrārius, item agricola. Calefus operam figulīnam, 
lōrāriam, fūnāriam potius exercēbat; māteriam quoque caedēbat 
libēns. Totopillus, ut anteā, culīnae sē dabat: item cālō erat 
atque aurīga, et hortulānus et lanius et auceps. Multam hic 
habuit in condendīs dēcipulīs perītiam. Numquam ego nē ūnum 
quidem cunīculum resticulīs potuī capere; at Totopillus 
porcillōs plūrimōs, avēs innumerābilēs, laqueīs convolūtīs aut 
suspēnsīs capiēbat: hinc illae cēnārum dēliciae, illa pennārum 
plūmārumque cōpia, quam mīrātus eram; hinc nūperrimē gallus 
Indicus cum gallīnīs. Etenim Gelavius patriō suō rēgulō vestem 
pulcherrimam, ē multicolōribus avium plūmīs contextam, dōnō 
dedit, quālis in Angliā caballī pretium afferret. 

334. Videō porrō mē ipsum, velut in Brazīliā quondam, oportēre 
nunc prō operārum praefectō esse. Nauticam quidem rem ipse prō 
mē suscēpī; sed in nendō ē foliīs fīlum, in complicandō cannās, 
juncōs,—multa faciēbant fēminae. Līnāmenta lucernārum torquent, 
oleam palmārum exprimunt. Ē lignāriā fabrōrum arte plēraque jam 
Gelavius exercēbat et quidquid jubērem, perficiēbat 
prūdentissimē. In vīminibus cannīsque contexendīs perītissimī 
erant omnēs. Hic autem locī affirmāre oportet quid dē barbarīs 
sentiam, nōn omnibus, sed multīs, quōs nōs Anglī nimium 
contemnimus. Errās valdē et pessimē cōnsulis, sī longē ex 
ipsōrum cōnsuētūdine velīs eōs dētorquēre; attamen hunc errōrem 
sī dēclīnās,—sī apertē ingenuē fidēliter jūstē agās,—multō 
fidēliōrēs tibi erunt quam quis putāverit; mox mīram 
sagācitātem, grātōs animōs generōsōsque, aliāsque virtūtēs 
neutiquam spernendās dēprehendēs summam inter barbariem. Nōs 
autem, heu lūgubrī fātō! nostra commūnicāmus vitia, illōsque 
dēdiscimus nātīvās ipsōrum virtūtēs; dein incertīs ex causīs 
inimīcitiae īnsurgunt, dōnec hostīle odium mītia commercia 
pessumdet. 335. Prīma autem mihi cūra post nūptiās erat, ut ⸤rēs 
comparātās⸥ melius ōrdinārem, ūnamquamque suō in loculō. Novās 
ut ōllās largiōrēsque praeparāret Calefus, urgēbam, argillamque 
unde habēret, indicāvī. Ego autem, quoniam veterēs nōn 
sufficiunt arcae, majus quiddam, armāriī īnstar, eum mēnsīs 
interiōribus, condō. Forēs illās diaetae nauticae prīncipālis, 
quae suprā biennium apud mē jacuerant, prō hujus armāriī foribus 
adhibeō. Illud opus mē per sex diēs exercuit. Totopillum jussī 
cūrātissimē dēligere, quid prīmum dēbēret cōnsūmī, quid in 
saccharō cōnservandum, quid per sē posset cōnsistere. Is autem 
dioscōreīs, maniocīs, cucumibus in novō agellō per sē dedit 
operam. Quotiēs aliquid aut piscium aut carnis erat cōnsūmendum, 
plūrēs didicerat reservāre reliquiās, quibus ⸤ēlixīs propter 
canem ac fēlēs⸥ massae farīnulentae vel alius cibus gustum 
dērīvārent idōneum. 336. Mox dē oleō ac saccharō erat 
prōvidendum, dēque sagōne (quod appellant) et dē cērā palmārum. 
Palmīs aliquot succīsīs, aut farīnulentam medullam aut cēram 
habēbāmus: folia, cannās, stīpitēs, ad suōs quidque ūsūs 
adhibēmus. Maximam autem et oleī et saccharī cōpiam jam nunc 
cēnsuī parandam. Saccharum Gelavius, optimum illud quidem, ē 
palmā quādam affatim dētulit: Borassum Flābellifōrmem, ut nunc 
audiō, appellant arborem. 337. Post haec dē agricultūrā 
dubitābam. Zēam quam maximē accūrandam opīnābar. Orȳzae plantās 
in hortīs dīxī invēnisse Gelavium; sed illam cultūram minus esse 
salūbrem crēdidī, nec posse nisi ūvidissimō in locō exercērī. 
Attamen Pachus et Calefus ōrant, ut sibi liceat hanc rem 
administrāre: itaque ipsīs remīsī, simul indicāns zēam ā mē 
orȳzae antepōnī. 338. Pachus in cavernīs ōrdinandīs strēnuum sē 
praebet. Fēminae, adjuvante Gelaviō et māteriem suppeditante, in 
vestibus nectendīs valdē erant industriae; mox datō sāpōne, 
vestīmenta lavāre ēdocuī. Tandem, post duōs ferē mēnsēs, tōta 
mea familia suās habēbat sēdēs, satis ōrnātās, suāsque operās. 

339. Tantīs adjūmentīs suffultus, poteram esse ōtiōsior, immō 
sēgnior: nec laetior tamen eram. “Quōrsum haec?” interrogābam. 
“Num tōta mea vīta sīc est dēgenda,—rēs opīmās colligendō, 
cōnsūmendō? An meliōrem aliquam religiōnem poterō hīs barbarīs 
impertīre? Tentandum est fortasse: sed linguam meam imprīmīs 
perdiscant oportet. Anne hōrum operā ecquandō patriam recuperābō 
meam?” Tālibus exercitus cōgitātiōnibus maestior fīēbam ac 
taciturnior: id vērō sentiō pessimī esse exemplī. Etenim nisi 
multum colloquar, nē Gelavius quidem nec Totopillus garrient 
Anglicē; tum cēterī nōn poterunt discere. Statuō fābellīs ac 
nārrātiunculīs, quotiēs cēnāmus, abundāre; et, cum Gelaviō 
imprīmīs, item cum Totopillō, dē religiōne sermōnēs habēre 
seorsum. 340. Equidem jam prīdem dē meā ipsīus historiā quaedam, 
praecipuē dē naufragiō, illīs nārrāveram; sed plūrima tunc parum 
intellēxēre, atque iterum audīre avēbant. Nunc autem prīmum 
clārē dīxī quondam fuisse mē Maurī hominis barbarī servulum; id 
quod animōs eōrum adeō perculit, ut singula quaeque audīre 
cupīverint magnopere. Ego autem quae plūrēs per diēs tunc 
nārrāvī, nōn cēlārem lēctōrem meum, nisi dictū longiuscula 
forent. Profectō illa servitūs crūdum meum et praeferōcem animum 
salūbriter mītigāvit; et quoniam erum nōn crūdēlem habuī, multa 
tum didicī sub Experientiā magistrā. Porrō illā in terrā 
calōribus assuēvī, immō rōbustior fīēbam. Sōl ōrae Marocānae, 
nostrō longē ācrior, aurā Ōceanī temperātur, neque nōbīs est 
īnsalūber, modo caput fasciā sindonis involvās, et vīnō 
abstineās prōrsus. Illīc quoque plūrima didicī dē frūgibus, dē 
oleribus, dē fruticibus, quae posteā erant ūtilia. Plūrimās rēs 
item minōre didicī apparātū facere, quam quō apud nōs fīunt. 
Quippe ferrāmenta agrestia, domesticam supellectilem, 
īnstrūmentum culīnae, pistrīnī, fabricae,—offendī illīc rudiōra 
omnia; sed Necessitās inventrīx multa simpliciter cōnficit, quae 
fātō quōdam meō discēbam. Dēnique ipsō industriae frūctū 
superbiēns, strēnuus operis ēvāsī, versūtus ad excōgitandum 
patiēnsque labōris. 341. Sed ad rem redeō. Aliud quoque jam 
aequum vidēbātur. Quoniam continuus labor ad vītam nōn jam erat 
necessārius, fēstīque aliquot diēs ipsīs barbarīs assolent, 
septimus diēs (quem prīmum vel Dominī diem appellāmus) 
Chrīstianōrum mōre dēbēbat tandem distinguī; ex quō religiōnis 
aliqua posset cūra exorīrī. Itaque Kalendāriō meō recēnsō, 
quisnam sit “diēs Dominī” discernō: tum subditīs meīs ēdīcō, ut 
fēstus sit hic diēs: quō diē item cōram mē post mātūtīnum cibum 
congregentur. Ego rēgium monīle gerēns, precem brevem Nūminī 
Suprēmō prōnūntiō, ut suō hālitū mentēs nostrās pūrget; illum 
quoque ipsīus propter virtūtēs adōrō: posteā litterārum 
rudīmenta cūnctōs doceō, ut novam linguam profundius animīs 
dēfīgam. 342. Sī pluvia cadit, in mūsēō congregāmur; ego in 
tabulam ligneam crētā scrībō: sīn serēnum est caelum, ubi arēna 
subtīlis ac plāna est potissimum, ibi radiō maximās dēsignō 
litterās. Ea imprīmīs vocābula, quae saepissimē prōnūntiantur, 
docuī scrībere, ut nōmina rērum, Homō, Vir, Fēmina, Canis, 
Pānis; ut verba commūnia, Fac, Dīc, Dā mihi, Venī, Abī; ut 
prōnōminā, Ego, Tū, Nōs, Vōs, Hic, Ille, Sīc.—Prīmō quidnam 
vellem faceremve, parum intellegēbant; sed quum īdem sonus eādem 
cum litterā saepius audiēbātur, sentiēbam eōs excitārī. Gelavius 
prīmus ōrābat, ut sibi licēret rem iterāre. Dein incipit ā Mē, 
Tē, Sē; item Nōs, Vōs, Hī, Hōs, Sīc, Dīc; et postquam bis terque 
est ā mē ēdoctus, optimē perdidicit brevia vocābula tot, quot 
omnibus elementīs comprehendendīs sufficerent. Mox ego tōtam 
litterārum seriem, in parvā chartā cōnscrīptam, ipsī trādō. 343. 
Gelavius sānē et Totopillus, quī quae dīcerem intellegēbant, 
longē celerius ipsās discēbant litterās. Hōs amplius in diēs 
ēdocuī. Proximō diē Dominicō cēterīs ipsī praecipiēbant. Tandem 
furor discendī cūnctōs pervāsit magnus, quandō hōs vīdērunt et 
intellegere et prō magistrīs esse: sed multa nōn poterant 
legere, quī paucissima vocābula nōverant. 344. Mox ā mē exquīrit 
Gelavius, ex quānam rē cōnficiātur charta. Ego dē papȳrō, dē 
līnō, dē gossypiō faciō certiōrem; explicō item dē membrānā sīve 
pergamēnā. Multa posteā folia grandiuscula ad mē reportat, 
siccat in sōle, premit, lēvigat; juncōs item aquā mācerātōs 
contundit, gummī miscet, explānat, chartās meās imitāns, sed 
parum rēs cessit: tandem ē praegrandibus palmae cujusdam foliīs 
satis bonam cēnset habērī chartam. Dīxī huic arundinēs ac pennās 
avium prō calamīs scrīptōriīs sufficere, prō ātrāmentō succum 
sēpiae; gummī addendum, sī liquor in chartā nimis difflueret. 
Ille cōnfirmat, numquam sibi dēfutūrum scrībendī īnstrūmentum, 
modo artem ipsam mente arripuerit. Jam ūnam quotīdiē hōram 
litterās eum doceō. Diē Dominī quaecumque nova vocābula cēterī 
didicerint, ea doceō scrībere; paulātimque, quum plūra 
intellegunt, quaedam dē religiōne incipiō inculcāre. 

345. Cum Gelaviō līberius dē rēbus dīvīnīs loquēbar. Quidquid dē 
Deō Creātōre, dē lēge mōrālī atque officiīs, dē sānctō Deī 
jūdiciō, dē ejusdem in sānctōs grātiā dīcerem, id omne illī 
facile esse et quasi nātūrāle comperiō: etiam dē immortālitāte 
hūmānī animī (id quod mīrābar) jam crēdēbat. Sed quotiēs audērem 
dē Chrīstō, dē Mōse, dē Jūdaeīs nārrāre, ōtiōsus audiēbat, quasi 
quī mīrārētur quid haec ad sē attinērent: aliquandō fortiter 
contrā dīcēbat. Tandem diffīsus posse mē tantīs argūmentīs suam 
impertīre gravitātem, abstinuī, nē profundius mē dēmergerem. 

346. Nōn absurdum erit nārrāre, quantum Pachus suā arte ferrāriā 
fēminās adjūverit. Erant ē meō īnstrūmentō acūs quaedam minōrēs, 
item majōrēs sarcināriae. Hās Pachus multum admīrātur. Minōrēs 
nequit imitārī, sed utriusque fōrmae plūrēs prōcūdit grandēs, 
quās exacuit politque satis pulchrē, oculīs rēctē pertūsīs. 
Ūnīcuique fēminae dōnō dat trēs fōrmae utriusque: hīs vestēs, 
tegetēs, strāgula cōnsuunt. 

347. Gelavius identidem quaerit ex mē, numne paeniteat mē, quod 
plūrēs sumus: num velim ad trēs virōs rūrsum redigī: num sī prō 
octo octōgintā forēmus, id oportēret dolēre: num mālim paucōrum 
esse quam plūrimōrum rēgulus. Nesciēbam quōrsum haec 
intenderent: subesse quiddam mihi vidēbātur. Dēmum interrogō 
dīrēcta, anne cōnsultō tālia loquātur. Tum modestē ac candidē 
respondet: “Ō ere! tālis est hujus īnsulae jūcunditās, tālis 
omnium rērum cōpia atque commoditās, tālis tua ipsīus 
benevolentia, aequitās, sapientia; ut ego populārēs meōs vellem 
sānē multōs hīsce rēbus mēcum fruī. Nec dubitō fore ut illī 
velint eadem, sī modo licēret: tuum erit dīcere, sī id licēbit 
numquam.” Haec quum respondēret, haesitāvī cōnsiliī incertus. 
Mox dīxī: “sānē suīs esse illum benevolum: ego quid velle, quid 
nōlle dēbērem, id mihi ipsī neutiquam liquere.” Notāvī posteā 
cūnctōs, ultrā quod necesse erat, ampliāre cultūram. Id ipsum 
anteā fēcisse Totopillum memineram, tum quum hancce colōniam 
clam meditābantur: itaque crēdō omnēs eandem fovēre spem, quam 
indicāverat Gelavius. Hoc mē male habet, nē nimis adverser, nēve 
perīculōsum quidpiam grātificer. 348. Iterum ē Gelaviō quaerō 
quot novōs colōnōs tūtō posse venīre crēdat, et quānam sub lēge: 
num tot modo quot in ūnā familiā nōbīscum aetātem possint 
dēgere.—Respondet, “semper sē crēdere, fore ut ego in patriam 
restituar: quippe, ubi ūna vēnerit nāvis, aliquandō tandem 
ventūram esse alteram. Tum sē suōsque, optimō dēfēnsōre orbōs, 
parvam manum pollentibus barbarīs relinquī: nam hōs quoque 
aliquandō ventūrōs, nec, nisi aut igneīs tēlīs aut majōre 
catervā, posse abigī. Tot ergā novās familiās, quot firmō sint 
praesidiō, esse optandās. Mīlle virōs nimis multōs nōn fore, sed 
quīnquāgintā contrā ējectāmenta maris sufficere.” Interrogō, 
quid sibi velint maris ējectāmenta. Sīc ille explicat, ut dīcat, 
“virōs quī in scaphīs per cāsūs maris hūc advehantur invītī.” 
Vīs ergō (inquam) quīnquāgintā importāre familiās? “Sī licēret, 
vellem,” respondet. At Gelavī! (rūrsus ajō) id nōn per mē 
licēbit. Propter locōs, arborēs, antilopās, piscēs, avēs, nūlla 
nōn erit pugna atrōx. Nēmō mihi obtemperābit nēmō intelleget: 
ego inter prīmōs occīdar. 349. “Āh, nē tālia fingās,” (inquit): 
“nē metuās, ere! Prius certē ego moriar: sed nōn nōstī meam 
gentem.” Dīc quōmodo (inquam). “Prīmum, ere! (respondet) hominēs 
sumus, nōn bēstiae; itaque et Deum et prīncipem venerāmur. 
Quisquis fortitūdine, prūdentiā, jūstitiā excellit, hunc 
extollere, decorāre, sequī amāmus. Tālis tū es vir, quī strēnuē 
ac jūstē regere callēs. Nostrōrum virōrum quot tē nōverint, tē 
prae nostrīs rēgulīs omnibus antepōnent. Dein, audī, quaesō, 
amplius. Summī nostrī rēgulī patruus est Cortops quīdam, optimus 
ille quidem vir, sed frātris fīlium sibi praepōnī aegrē fert, 
habetque factiōnem nōn parvam. Mītis est ac senior vir; fīliī 
autem ejus omnēs proeliō occubant. Is profectō tālem in īnsulam 
colōnōs dēdūcere vehementer cupiat: immō, id ipsum audīvī, ac 
crēdō. Jam sī hūc advenīret, ille et suōs cūnctōs facile 
regeret, et tibi obsequerētur officiōsissimē. Tum omnia illa dē 
locīs, arboribus, antilopīs, ex cōnsuētūdine nostrā ac sine 
pugnā ōrdinābuntur.” Optimē causam dīcis, Ō Gelavī (respondeō) 
et callidē adūlāris; sed nimiā mē sōlicitūdine tōta haec rēs 
excruciāret: quārē amplius dē eā nē colloquāmur. 

350. Nōs autem, ita ut dīxī, cursum nostrum tenēbāmus, nec 
paenitēbat mē meōrum subditōrum. Singula nārrāre dē tot 
hominibus, longum foret. Omnia quae egomet invēneram, paulātim 
discunt; sed Pachus novam rem repperit. Per Gelavium ā mē 
exquīsīverat, unde venīret ferrum. Dīxī, ē montibus effōdī, 
ejusque aspectum esse, tamquam in humum īnflūxisset, massāsque 
humī suā gravitāte implēvisset. Post aliquot diēs laetus 
renūntiat, ferrum ā sē in monte repertum. Ostendit marram, novō 
quōdam metallō crustātam. Explicant mihi, vīdisse eum, in 
ulteriōre altissimī illīus montis latēre, rīvulum quendam 
discolōrem, turbidum: marrā postquam concīverit, hanc 
concrēvisse crustam. Videō nōn ferream esse crustam illam, sed 
ahēneam. Respondeō, posse hoc multī esse ūsūs, quamquam nōn sit 
ferrum; amplius oportēre exāminārī. Posteā doceō tāle aes 
colligere et fabricāre, quotiēs ūsus vēnerit. 

351. Hiems hujus regiōnis praeterierat. Calidior tempestās 
appropinquābat; quotīdiānī imbrēs augēscēbant. Diē quōdam Mārtiī 
⸤solitō ācrius⸥ flābat ventus et continenter per noctem dūrāvit. 
Sub ipsum māne per tenuem pluviam ego cum Totopillō cocōrum 
sinum versus pergēbam, atque ā speculā meā videō lintrem terrae 
appropinquantem. Ēgrediuntur duo virī, ūna fēmina: tot modo 
inerant. Videō prōtinus pīrātās nōn esse hōs: virī dēfessī esse 
videntur, fēmina algēscere. Haec ubi ā ventō prōtegātur, 
vestibus contēctam collocant: ipsī vagantur, rāmōs aspectantēs, 
ut quī cibum anquīrunt. 352. Pistolās mēcum habuī, sed nihil 
erat quod timērem. Rāmulō arboris raptim abscissō, hunc ēlātē 
gerēns, cum Totopillō dēscendī, ciēbamque eōs clāmōre: neque 
illī ā nōbīs fūgērunt. Jussī Totopillum colloquī, sī forte 
intellegerent. Is cito cōnfirmat, esse eōs Gelaviī populārēs, 
ventō abreptōs, jamque famē, labōre, frīgore ēnectōs. Nōluī, in 
portum admissīs, sēcrēta domūs aperīre: sed jussī eum dīcere, 
“cibum iīs missum īrī,” et ipsum jūxtā manēre. Ego āctūtum 
redeō, tum Gelavium remittō cum cibō, uxōremque ejus cum spissīs 
siccīsque vestibus. Ipsī frūstrā cōnantur ignem fovēre. Fenis et 
Totopillus apud eōs morantur: Gelavius illicō ad mē redit: sīc 
jussī. Tum colloquimur. 

353. Ego ajō: sī per ventum nōn poterunt ante noctem regredī, 
numquam regredī dēbēre, nē plūrēs posteā in nōs reportent, 
pervulgātō īnsulae arcānō.—Is laudat cōnsilium meum, modo possit 
fierī. Mox addit: velle sē quidem plūrēs īnsulae cīvēs; sed 
invītōs retinēre, nisi vinciās, fore lūbricum; nam posse 
aliquandō scapham meam fūrārī.—Id mē perculit, nec quidquam 
ultrā dīxī: tamen eundem illum in sinum hospitēs coercēre 
statuō. Fenis autem rediēns ait, sibi illam fēminam anteā nōtam 
esse, et vērō dīlēctam, atque ejus sē miserērī. 354. Quandō 
refōtī sunt, tertiō diē dē reditū cōnsulitur. Erat sānē 
difficilis lintrī reditus, sī ventus eādem ex regiōne perstāret 
flāre, quamvīs clēmenter. Imperāvī ut nēmō retinēret eōs, nēmō 
abigeret, sed suīs relinquerentur cōnsiliīs. Multās nōbīs 
grātiās agunt, viāticō acceptō, ajuntque velle sē, ut prīmum 
possint, domum redīre. Quārtō demum diē ēvānuerant, sub noctem 
regressī. 

355. Haec erant in mēnse Mārtiō, neque ego tunc suspicābar quō 
mē invītum dīvīna dūceret Prōvidentia: nam novōs colōnōs 
arcessere pertināciter nōluī, quamvīs timērem nē meīs forem 
inīquus: sed sollicitūdō ācris semper mē vetābat. Continuābantur 
mēnsēs, et nostra omnium opera. Praeteriēre suō in ōrdine 
geniālis pluvia ac foeda tempestās: tertium jam mihi redībat 
siccior aestātis pars. Nōs quidem in frūctibus colligendīs tum 
maximē fuimus occupātī. 356. Ēn autem ipsō Sextīlī mēnse, dum 
cum Calefō et Totopillō per rūpem incēdō, ē saltū prōdeunt duo 
virī barbarī. Pistolā correptā, jubeō Totopillum eōs compellāre. 
Respondent, “amīcōs esse sē, et rēgem īnsulae amīcissimē 
petere.” Jubeō, meī honōris causā, tēla in humum prōjicere: 
prōjiciunt. Tunc ut amīcōs salūtō, recipere tēla jubeō, et 
dīcere cūr, unde, vēnerint. Totopillus, parum facile, tamen 
interpretātur respōnsa. Senior autem ē duōbus illīs, mītis 
aspectū vir, quī ferē septuāgintā habēre vidēbātur annōs, in 
hunc modum loquitur. “Ego sum Cortops. Cum quīndecim lintribus 
veniō, octo et vīgintī familiīs, ut tuā veniā cum bonā pāce 
cōnsīdāmus hāc in īnsulā, tibi prō summō prīncipe obtemperātūrī. 
Cēterōs īnfrā relīquī, dum tua reportāmus jussa. Agrum autem ex 
tuā abundantiā ā tē ōrāmus.” Quia dē rē inopīnātā illicō 
respondēre erat difficile, multum salvēre jussī; hic in saltū 
requiēsceret paulisper: honōris causā hōs duōs meōrum apud eum 
relinquī: mē celeriter cum servīs cibīsque reditūrum: tum nōs dē 
omnī hāc rē līberē collocūtūrōs. 357. Itaque dēcessī sōlus. 
Prōditum mē crēdidī. Gelavius sine dubiō nūntium Cortopī per 
illōs virōs mīserat, quoniam mē obstinātum sēnsit. Tamen sī 
trīgintā virī armātī jam in terram expositī erant, per vim 
tēlōrum male resistō palam: arte et sollertiā est opus. Aut 
suādēre dēbeō ut prōtenus abeant, aut dēlīberāre quō tandem 
pactō minimō cum perīculō maneant, sīve ad tempus, sīve in 
perpetuum. 358. Interim īrāscor Gelaviō et incipiō objūrgāre. 
Ille admīrāns, obnīxē ac simplicissimē negat quidquam nūntiī sē 
aut mīsisse aut missum velle; idque iterāvit tam ānxiē, ut 
nequīverim persistere. Jam hunc cum Pachō cibōs ac dōna aliquot 
relātūrum mittō. Ipse, rēgālia assūmēns, meminī Fenim fuisse 
fēminae illīus amīcam. Igitur, missā ad eam Larī, arcessō, et 
īrātā vōce interrogō, quidnam hospitī dīxerit. Illa, quamquam 
male loquerētur, tamen, quae dīcēbam, satis intellēxit. 359. 
Effūsa in lacrimās respondet, sē, ab amīcā suā rogitātam, anne 
commodē sē hīc habēret, dīxisse; “Immō optimē: sānē sē esse 
beātissimam sub benignissimō ac jūstissimō prīncipe in 
jūcundissimā īnsulā.” Tālia eam velle dīcere, sermōne quamvīs 
inconditō, intellēxī. “An nihil aliud dīxistī?” interrogō. “Sānē 
plūrima,” inquit. Quid ergō? “At ego nesciō.”—Nōnne tū nūntium 
ad Cortopem mīsistī, ut hūc venīret? “Certē nihil tāle audērem (
inquit) neque ausa sum.” Sed nēminem tū hūc invītāstī? “Ōh ere (
respondet), invītāvī nēminem; tantum, ut crēdō, amīcae meae 
dīxī,—Vellem ipsam et quam plūrimōs meōrum sub optimō tē 
prīncipe esse beātōs, velut mēmet.” Postquam experior nihil 
ultrā scīscitandō extorquērī, vultum compōnō: bonō animō eam 
esse jubeō: dein ēgredior. 360. Incēdēns simul reputō. Sī rē 
vērā propter fāmam meī, nōn propter cupiditātem malam, tot virī 
veniunt; tum vērō, sī prōrsus eōs vēnisse nōlim, ipse mēmet 
objūrgāre dēbeō, quod nōn fuerim injūstior; neque adeō sunt 
timendī, quī ad imperāta perferenda festīnant. Meae mē laudēs 
fortasse ēmolliēbant: nūlla convincitur prōditiō. Tum illud 
surgit:—quattuor ope virōrum numquam hīc nāvem fabricābor: sī 
redīre ad patriam volō, per plūrēs id dēbet cōnficī. Quid sī 
nunc plūrēs Deus ipse ad mē mīsit? Egone illōs abigam, in 
aeternam mēmet redāctūrus barbariem? Reputāns tālia, cum aliō 
prōrsus animō ad Cortopem revertī, quī cibōs jam cōnfēcerat, et 
cane meō, propter offulās blandientī, sē oblectābat. 361. 
Nūntiātur mihi, cūnctam ejus plēbem esse in portū hortōrum; sub 
arboribus ā calōre prōtegī: habēre sēcum maximum zēae atque 
orȳzae numerum, item maniocārum; coria quoque comportāre et 
maximās vestēs, tegetēsque quae malignam imbrium vim possint 
arcēre: quadrāgintā duōs virōs puerōsve esse, septem et 
quīnquāgintā fēminās: Cortopis omnēs dictō oboedīre: ipsum 
Cortopem mihi profectō velle submittī, cōnstanter autem ā mē 
ōrāre sēdem idōneam.—Respōnsum fēcī plēnum benevolentiā. 
Pollicitus sum, illicō mē dēmissūrum, quī ligna secāret in 
focōs, atque alterum quī plūra ⸤cibō commoda⸥ distribueret, 
velut oleum, sāl, arōmata: tertium quī ōllās cācabōsque ferret. 
Interim mē dē sēde dandā meditātūrum.—Mox nōs redīmus cavernās 
versus, duo illī virī ad suōs. Quandō animadvertī auram extrā 
ōrdinem ā merīdiē continuārī modicam, melius cēnseō ut in scaphā 
⸤Gelavius cum patre socerōque⸥ supellectilem ac cibum portet. 
Gelavius ⸤minōribus gemmīs fulgēns⸥ mē repraesentat. Hic lignum 
secat, illī prandium properant. 362. Ego autem sub sēricā 
umbellā propter fastum ac calōrem tēctus, ad Caprīnum jugum 
dēflectō, atque, inde prōspectāns, novae colōniae dēcernō longam 
illam ōram subter jugō, cum prīmō sinū citrā Lūnātam Viam, sī eō 
quoque egērent. Sed ōra illa facile suffectūra erat. Postulō ut 
septimus quisque diēs prō fēstō habeātur; ut, quot possint, illō 
diē cōram mē veniant; ut Cortops quater in annō, ad minimum, mē 
venerātūrus adeat; ut mea lingua prō imperātōriā linguā 
aestimētur, quam cūnctī, ut prīmum possint, discant ēloquī. Hīs 
acceptīs lēgibus, proximō diē circumrēmigant, suamque capiunt 
sēdem. 

363. Paulō post clārius dēnotō; quidquid sit illā in ōrā, 
Cortopis esse, sine ūllā exceptiōne. Quāslibet avēs, quōslibet 
piscēs, illā tantum in ōrā, prō suīs oportēre eum aestimāre. Sīn 
ultrā līneam altissimī jugī Caprīnī voluerit vēnārī aut frūctum 
terrae percipere, id mēcum amplius dēlīberandum. Sī quid in 
monte velit sēminārī, id līberum esse; et quidquid coluerit 
quispiam, id fore cultōris.—Hās quoque lēgēs comprobārunt: tum 
ego sollicitūdinem dēpōnēbam. 

364. Mox ligōnēs, secūrēs, dolābrās plūrimās dēligō, item marrās 
aliquot et cultrōs mēnsālēs, quōs Cortopī dōnō dem, suae plēbī 
ad suum arbitrium distribuendōs. Cultrum, furcam et cochleāre, 
splendidiōre speciē, ipsī dēstinō Cortopī. Saccharī aliquantum 
et oleī addō, item arōmata. Hās rēs ille cupidissimē ac multīs 
cum grātiīs accipit. Tum, nē gemmīs Gelavius praelūceat, monīlī 
pulchrius variātō exōrnō Cortopem. 365. Posteā aliud quiddam 
mihi arrogō:—Sī hostēs hanc in īnsulam dēscendant, ut sub 
Cortope cūnctī imperāta mea perficiant, cōnferantque subsidia 
bellī.—Id quoque facile concēditur. Tum citrea atque aurea māla, 
cocōs nucēs ūvāsque siccātās, et cōnservātārum ananassārum ōllās 
ad Cortopem dēmittō.



CAPUT (XIII.) TREDECIMUM.


366. Jamque post violentam concitātiōnem rēs ad suōs cursūs 
rediēre. Sēdecim post diēbus aestās procellīs abrumpitur: piget 
mē quod cavernīs hospitēs carent. Ego autem dē meā linguā 
intrūdendā praesertim sollicitābar. Prīma mea colōnia et linguam 
nōn absurdē et litterās parcē didicerat: nunc meditor quō possim 
pactō eāsdem novae plēbī impertīre. Quandō cum Gelaviō 
colloquor, rogat ille, utrum velim eum assentīrī oboedienter, an 
loquī līberē. Līberē autem (inquam) loquī. 367. Tum īnfit: “Nōs, 
ere, tua familia, tē et multum audīvimus et valdē amāmus: igitur 
in linguā litterīsque prōfēcimus melius. Tamen nimius fuit ille 
cōnātus, nec nisi propter tuī amōrem tolerābilis. Duās rēs ūnā 
postulās, utramque difficilem. Crēde mihi, longē praestat, ut dē 
linguā tuā paulum differātur. Nostram potius nōs linguam prīmum 
litterīs exprimere discāmus: posteā quidquid ē tuā didicerint 
linguā (et discent multa paulātim) cupient ipsī scrībere.” 368. 
Haec audiēns, quasi obstupuī. Quid? (inquam): tūne linguam 
barbaram vīs litterīs effingere, et quantum possīs, in perpetuum 
dēfīgere?—Ācriter respondet: “Nostrae tū, ere, nescius es 
linguae, quī barbaram vocās. Lingua est cōpiōsa, dēlicāta, 
subtīlis, tenerrima, sonō mollissima, ūsū gravissima: immō, 
quantum conjicere possim, tuā sānē praestantior.” Quid ais? 
inquam. Ego nōn nōvī tuam linguam: rēctē dīcis. Sed cūr crēdis 
eam meae antecellere? “Ēn (ait) quandō tū Nōs dīcis, ego illud 
Nōs per quattuor vocābula interpretor. Nam aut Ego ac tū valet, 
aut Ego atque ille, aut Ego ac vōs, aut Ego atque illī. Hīc 
quattuor sunt, quae tua lingua in ūnum illud Nōs cōnfundit; 
nostra pulcherrimē distinguit Bini, Bili, Binir, Bilir. Nōnne 
hanc rēctē dīcō magis hīc esse subtīlem, accūrātam, cōpiōsam?” 
Assentior. “Item Vōs (pergit dīcere) duās cōnfundit rēs; nam aut 
valet Tū cum cēterīs quōs compellō, aut Tū cum quibusdam 
absentibus. Hīc iterum nostrātēs duo habent vocābula, Vinir, 
Dinir. Jam tū dē fronte contrahendā loqueris; ūnam hanc ā tē 
didicī locūtiōnem: nōs quattuor habēmus verba simplicia. Nam 
frontem contrahō aut propter lūcem nimiam, aut meditābundus, aut 
cum maerōre, aut cum malitiā: nōs quadrifāriam dīcimus ac 
simpliciter.” Perge ultrā, (inquam). “Deinde tū (inquit) dē 
dēmittendō capite loqueris: nōs septem vel amplius modīs hoc 
prōnūntiāmus. Nam caput dēmittō, prīmum ut hostīle tēlum vel 
rāmum arboris dēvītem: deinde, ut venerer aliquem; tum, ut 
acūtius prōspeculer; quārtō, ut assēnsum dēnotem; quīntō, 
propter pudōrem; sextō, per obstinātam contumāciam; septimō, in 
aquās dēscēnsūrus; item octāvō, saltāns. Ēn octo nostrātium 
vocābula, Metic, Rodic, Fiarilic, Duthic, Lianic, Shanfic, 
Madiric, Reutic.”—Immō, Gelavī! (inquam interpellāns) linguam tū 
meam parum nōvistī: nam nōs Annuere adhibēmus, assēnsum capitis 
dēmissī dēnotantēs. 369. “Vērissimē dīxistī illud, ere! (
respondet). Nōn nōvī tuam linguam, neque umquam plēnē nōverō, 
nisi sī possem renāscī, et cum lacte mātris cārissimās vōcēs 
haurīre; nisi possem cum puerīs iterum collūdere, in vestrīs 
lūdīs litterāriīs discere; nisi possem in contiōne sapientium 
fervida captāre verba, atque in forō, ubi rēs vēnditis, multōs 
per mēnsēs nūndinārī. Nisi dē novō possem mātris, sorōris 
cāritātem discere, et suāvēs amōris susurrōs nunc prīmum tuā in 
linguā audīre, numquam sīc ego complectar eam, ut tū corde atque 
animō complecteris.” Fateor; vehementiā ejus perculsus sum. 
Nihil tāle expectāveram: itaque reticuī. Tum addit,—“Ō ere, nōlī 
succēnsēre: sed ita sē rēs habet. Lingua tua nōbīs in meram 
mentem venit, quasi cum frīgidā lūce. Nostra pectus tangit, 
animum ērigit. Ut tuam nōs, quantum possīmus, discāmus linguam, 
aequissimē postulās; sed nostram quae tenerrimīs nōs memoriīs 
perfundit, nōlī sīc surripere nōbīs, ut tuam mancē 
apprehendāmus, fortasse foedē lacerēmus.” 

370. Numquam anteā suspicātus eram, quam sua cuique gentī 
pretiōsa esset lingua. Post paulō fassus sum, male mē 
cōnsuluisse, Gelavium rēctē jūdicāre: itaque jubeō, sī possit, 
populārēs suōs ēdocēre, quō pactō ipsōrum linguam litterīs 
exprimant. Tum ille ā mē opem ōrat. Dīcit, meīs litterīs illōrum 
sonōs nōn omnīnō congruere; proptereā, sē haerēre. Equidem nōn 
modo Lusitānicē multa dē orthographiā (quam appellant) 
cōgitāveram; sed prius, quandō Maurūsiē discēbam loquī, omnia 
Eurōpaeīs cōnscrībēbam litterīs, mūtātīs additīsque aliquot 
fōrmīs. 371. Igitur ferē centum audītīs perscrīptīsque vōcibus, 
tandem quum autumat omnēs linguae sonōs sē mihi prōnūntiāsse, 
facile eī tōtam seriem explicō. Hoc ubi plūrifāriam probāvit, 
crēdiditque rem cōnfectam, tōtum gregem nostrum ēdocet; illī 
alacriter arripiunt. Posteā, diē Dominī, quandō cēterī 
conveniunt, incipit hōrulam dare huic reī impertiendae. Ego 
autem illō diē contiōnor dē rēbus plūribus, quae possint mentēs 
stimulāre, excolere, firmāre. 372. Illud laetus videō, nōn esse 
sēgnēs hōs barbarōs neque ventrī aut tēmētō dēditōs. Etenim 
vēlōcēs esse et armīs strēnuōs, id cūnctī prō pūblicō officiō 
aestimābant. Sed lūdōs sēdulō iīs commendō. Fēminae nostrae 
quotīdiē natābant, sed suō in grege: nōs virī jam ⸤dumtaxat 
extrā portum⸥ natāmus. Ego sīc jussī: namque ipsīs nōn interesse 
vidēbātur. 373. At ego jam dēcernō, igneōrum tēlōrum ūsum 
Gelaviō ac Totopillō impertīre, quō tūtior fīam. Id summō cum 
gaudiō accipiunt, ut documentum fīdūciae meae. Pulveris nitrātī 
quia parcissimus fueram, aliquantum etiam restābat. Hoc reparārī 
posse dēspērāns, quidquid potest sine dispendiō pulveris docērī, 
ēdoceō, atque illī ācerrimē artem meam assequī cōnantur. 
Totopillus dē pulveris illīus compositiōne ācriter exquīrit. 
Carbōnem facile explicō; sed quid sit nitrum, quid sulfur, 
nequeō interpretārī; nec, propter immāne perīculum, vellem eum 
compōnendī experīmentīs sē objicere. Itaque hoc prō arcānō 
relinquitur. 374. Hāc aestāte ego ac Pachus in pēnsilibus lectīs 
super rūpe dormīverāmus: cēterī trēs cum uxōribus mālunt in 
cavernīs manēre; neque ego prohibeō. Pachum prō comite mēcum 
assūmō. 

375. Inter haec subita rēs iterum rotam meae vītae convertit, et 
dēmum mē parentibus, mihi patriam reddidit. Ante lūcem, tertiō 
ante Īdūs Decembrēs, bombus cannōnis mē expergēfacit. Iterātur 
ter quaterque. Agnōscō signum nāvis, quae opem in perīculō ōrat. 
Prīmā lūce per prōspeculum contemplor, videōque nāvem magnam, 
quae in arēnīs longē ā terrā haeret. Arbitror illās ipsās esse 
arēnās, ubi, quattuor ante annīs amplius, nostra nāvis sē 
impēgit, cōnfrēgitque mālōs. Attentius observāns, crēdō ūnum 
mālōrum esse cōnfractum. Mox vēxillum discernō: id erat 
Anglicum. Tum mīrō gaudiō, maerōre, spē afficior. 376. Mare erat 
tranquillissimum: vix ūlla tum flābat aura. Aciē oculōrum 
contentā, per prōspeculum nihil videō mōtūs neque īnstantis 
perīculī. Tum illud succurrit: Quidnī possumus, plūribus 
connītentibus scaphīs, remulcīs nāvem ex arēnā dētrahere? 
Gelavium jubeō properāre ad Cortopem, et meō nōmine impēnsē 
rogāre, ut lintrēs suās cūnctās cum rēmigibus rōbustissimīsque 
remulcīs ad nāvem mitteret, atque ⸤ā mē dicta⸥ eōs accipere 
jubēret. 377. Prōtenus ego cum Totopillō et Calefō Pachōque in 
scapham ingredior: nōs quattuor rēmigāmus, quoniam ventus deest. 
Cibum nōndum gustāverāmus, sed comportārī jussī quidquid esset 
in prōmptū. Prīmī ad nāvem pertingimus, mox Anglicā vōce 
exquīrō, ubinam sit praefectus nāvis. Illī mīrābundī, et 
laetantēs quamquam tantō in perīculō, eum ēvocant. Nārrat mihi, 
id quod ipse dispexeram. In lītus, nocte utique tranquillā, 
incurrerant, frēgerantque mālum anteriōrem. Etiam tum haerēbant, 
timēbantque nē surgente ventō obruerentur. Dīcō mē jussisse 
lintrēs rēmigēsque tractūrōs venīre, sī forte id opis esse 
posset. Tum certiōrem mē facit, fundum nāvis esse solidum, neque 
admīsisse aquam. Mox ā magistrō bolidem petiī, et ā scaphā meā 
tentābam aquās. Sex ulnae nāvī sufficiēbant. Meāns remeānsque in 
scaphā, submarīnī aggeris fīnem dīmidiō ferē hōrae satis 
comperī. Jam autem tredecim pervēnēre lintrēs. Magister mē 
docēbat, quot remulcīs esset opus: ipse affīgit, fūnēsque ex suō 
addit. Saburram trāmovet, partēs nāvis afflīctās levāns. Ejus 
dicta per mē et Gelavium trāduntur. Rēmīs incumbunt, gravius 
quam violentius prīmō. Remulcī tenduntur, strīdent. Exclāmat 
Gelavius: crēdō eum prohibuisse nimium intendī. Iterum; ter; 
quater incumbunt: dēmum nōn frūstrā esse videō. Mōtus quidem 
nāvis exiguus appāret, augēscit, continuātur: tandem clāmor 
gaudentium exoritur: nāvis vadō dētrahitur et prōtenus bene 
natat. 379. Tum magister ā mē gubernātōrem petit, quī in tūtum 
aliquem locum nāvem dēdūcat, dōnec mālus erit resartus. Multum 
ille mīrātur, quum respondeō, “nēminī cēterōrum quidquam dē hōc 
marī esse nōtum, mē sōlum lītoris aliquam habēre nōtitiam.” 
Rēmigibus per Gelavium indicō, spērāre mē rem rēctē prōcessūram: 
multās mē agere grātiās: sed parātī sint iterum adjuvāre, sī 
iterum sit opus. Interim aura diurna ā marī surrēxerat, et, 
vēlīs aliquot praetentīs, tardiusculē movēbātur nāvis. Ego in 
scaphā, profunditātem semper praetentāns, flūmen versus, in quod 
prīmam meam dīrēxī ratem, sēnsim dēdūcēbam. Sed quoniam tempus 
procellōsum longē aberat, suāsī ut ancoram extrā jaceret, deinde 
per suōs nautās explōrāret ōstium. Assēnsus est. Tum ego meōs 
virōs cum scaphā domum remittō, ipse in nāvī maneō colloquiī 
grātiā. 380. Prōtenus magister quaerit, anne novum possit mālum 
apud nōs emere. Respondeō: “Immō, secāre. Esse plūrimās suprā 
arborēs, mālīs idōneās; quās succīsās posse facile in vallem 
dētrūdī, et, in rīpā flūminis dēdolātās, aquā vehī ad nāvem. In 
ōstiō flūminis tūtissimum esse portum vel furentibus procellīs, 
modo profunditās aquae nāvem admittat.” 381. Jam quaerit, anne 
cibōs praebēre possīmus. Id vērō prōmittō. Illicō jubet prandium 
omnibus appōnī līberius, nārratque parcius per plūrēs diēs 
comēdisse cūnctōs, quia metuerant inopiam. Ego vērō interrogō, 
quārē hās in regiōnēs vēnerint, utrum gnārī an invītī. Ille 
postquam quaedam imperāvit, seorsum ductum humilī mē vōce 
compellat. 382. “Tū mē (inquit) valdē adjūvāstī; ergō līberē 
loquar. Mercēs ego Anglicās ā Bristoliā ad Jamaicam dēbēbam 
portāre. Propter vim ventī in Corragiam Hībernōrum cōnfugere sum 
coāctus.” Ibi aliquot meōrum nautārum majōre mercēde mihi 
surripit alius quīdam nāvis magister. Tum aliōs ex necessitāte 
accēpī, quālēs ipse locus dabat, mercēnāriōs nautās, quōrum trēs 
erant valdē improbī. Multa mōlientēs, sēditiōnem serēbant et 
bonōrum pervertēre mentēs. Tandem coortī, in catēnās mē dedēre, 
quum maximē erāmus in Occidentālis Indiae marī. Quid dē mē 
facere voluerint, nesciō; sed cēterī nautae nihil gravius in mē 
cōnsulī patiēbantur. Oculōs Eurōpaeōrum fugientēs, inter 
barbarōs (ut opīnor) sē volēbant recondere, crēdēbantque sē 
posse dītēscere, dīvēnditīs meīs mercibus. Ūnā ex ōrā optimam 
aquae cōpiam assecūtī sunt, absentibus barbarīs; mox, ubi cibōs 
volēbant emere, ortō jūrgiō, duo ē nāvālibus sociīs occīsī sunt, 
quōrum ūnus callidissimus erat ē tribus illīs improbīs. Cēterī, 
quī cum scaphā erant, aegrē effūgēre. Duo illī, quī restābant ē 
pessimīs, hominēs imperītī, vī ac minīs ac cōnsuētūdine quādam 
nāvem regēbant, quamquam caelī ac maris et chartārum marīnārum 
ignārī. Cibōs iterum ac ter frūstrā quaesīvēre: propter inopiam 
alimentōrum cēterī murmurābant: dēmum proximā nocte sub aurōram 
in arēnās incurrimus. Tum vērō imperītiae hōrum hominum 
succēnsentēs, nautae eōs catēnīs vinciunt, mē līberant, ōrantque 
ut sontēs pūniam, cēterōs ā perīculō līberem. Ego statim 
cannōnēs opem ōrantēs personāre jussī: illud restat, ut sī 
possim, quod male factum est, resarciam. Jam autem, dīc mihi, (
quod maximī est) quot gradūs terrestris longitūdinis hīc 
habeāmus. 383. Paene rīsī, quum haec mē interrogāret. Respondeō: 
illum ā meō vestītū posse conjectāre, quantā in barbariē verser. 
Locī sānē lātitūdinem, stēllīs observātīs, cognōsse mē; 
longitūdinem (quam appellant mathēmaticī) prōrsus nescīre. Id 
tantum mē habēre cognitum, ad Occidentem nōs dēgere, ultrā 
ultimum Orinocōnis ōstium.—Ille ait, etiam hoc cognōsse, magnī 
referre. 384. Mox interrogō, anne velit mē in patriam reportāre. 
Is cōnfirmat, maximō illud sibi gaudiō fore; nec grātiīs modo 
revectūrum; nam propter servātam nāvem magnum mihi ā sē suīsque 
dēbērī praemium. Tum jussī, dē ⸤hōc quod dīcēbam⸥ reticēre; 
jamque mē in suā scaphā ad terram vehere, ut dē cibīs 
comparandīs imperārem. 385. Ūndēvīgintī virī in nāve erant: 
carnem recentem Anglīs crēdō fore libentibus. Totopillō dīcō, sī 
laqueīs porcillōs, leporēs avēsve possit capere, quam plūrimōs 
capiat, ac vīvōs. Pachum ac Calefum, trahā ac trahulā ēductā (
illā duōbus jūmentīs, hāc ūnō) mēcum ad collēs Caprīnōs venīre 
jubeō; Larim Fenimque in calathōs plūrēs fiscellāsque compōnere 
dioscōreās, maniocās, banānās, dactylōs, aliōsque frūctūs vel 
legūmina: Upim cāseōs prōmere quōs habēbat plūrimōs, et quidquid 
piscium sale condītum reservāverat,—sī id quoque nautīs ūsuī 
foret. Ōva gallīnācea mihi nōn erant: pullīs avibus parcendum 
dēcrēvī. Dēnique Gelavium ad Cortopem mittō, ōrāns ut sī quid 
aut zēae aut orȳzae possit sine suōrum dētrīmentō trādere, id 
meā grātiā nāvī convehendum praebeat. 

386. Pachum ac Calefum jam summā in rūpe offendī opperientēs. 
Caprārum silvestrium agrōs versus īmus rēctā, usque eō ubi 
propter asperitātem saxōrum nūllā erat trahīs via. Tum Pachum 
jubeō quam occultissimē, mōre barbarōrum, pōne saxa īnserpere, 
dōnec gregem aliquem intrā tēlī conjectum videat. Ignipultās 
duās iīs trādideram portandās: ūna erat bituba mea. Ambās jam 
sufferciō. Ut Pachus recurrit, prōgredior cautē, etsī neutiquam 
fugācēs erant hae ferae. Ē duplice tubō bis maximā celeritāte 
jaculātus, duās antilopās occīdō. Tōtus grex aufugit; sed 
propter fōrmam locōrum nōn poterat extrā jactum extemplō 
ēvānēscere. Alterā ignipultā dē Calefō arreptā, tertium prōtenus 
dējiciō mortuum: is mās fuit, grandis ille quidem, quī 
restiterat hostem cōnspectūrus. Jūmenta nostra paxillīs 
dēstināverāmus: eō jam necesse erat praedam dēportāre. Calefus 
et Pachus, connīsī, satis aegrē humerīs suīs caprās, ūnam post 
alteram, dēferunt. Caprum antilopam videō nimium fore: quārē 
egomet, onerī submissus, adjuvō. Sīc per trium virōrum nīsūs hic 
quoque in trahulam compōnitur: dein prōtinus domum eōs remittō. 
387. Egomet lacum versus properō, ut ānserēs vel ferum olōrem 
reportem. Ipsam ad lacūs ōram numquam pertigeram: ibi nunc 
olōrēs videō maximōs. Anne piscēs comedant, anne carō sit bona, 
nesciō; crēdō tamen piscēs ē dulcī aquā nōn nocitūrōs gustuī. 
Itaque igne conjectō maximum ālitem, quī vix in margine erat 
aquae, occīdō; quem, quamquam canis nōn aderat, facile assequor. 
Hunc reportāvī humerīs meīs, incommodum sānē onus. 388. Ad 
cavernās Cortopem offendō, quī collocūtūrus dē zēā et orȳzā 
vēnerat. Ā Pachō vult discere, quanta sit secundae spēs messis; 
item ā Totopillō quantam vim rādīcum esculentārum, aut ā nōbīs 
satam, aut genitam in vallibus, dēbeāmus exspectāre. Certior dē 
hīs rēbus factus, dēcrēvit et zēam et orȳzam praebēre satis 
līberāliter. Eum magnō cum honōre excipiō, ōrōque ut ad cēnam 
maneat. Plūrēs rēs in mūsēō nunc prīmum eī exhibeō. 389. Inter 
haec pervēnit Totopillus cum nāvis magistrō. Magister breviter 
ait, Ōstium flūminis ā sē esse explōrātum; satis superque esse 
aquae profundae; crās cum aestū maris velle sē intrāre. Ē valle 
Totopillum in rūpe ā sē vīsum esse; (is dē cunīculīs ibi 
satagēbat:) sē cursum suum ad eum dīrēxisse, ut ad mē dūcerētur.—
Totopillus sēcum habuit in sacculīs quattuor vīvōs, ūnum mortuum 
cunīculum; dein ego dēmōnstrō magistrō, quōs eī cibōs dēstinem. 
390. Is dē cēterīs rēbus multās agit grātiās; sed ūnum illum ait 
sufficere antilopam, duās fēminās nōlle. Nam tantam carnis vim 
corruptum īrī, nisi properē comedātur; nautīs autem quī decem 
per diēs parcius pāstī essent, īnsalūberrimum fore, sī multum 
subitō carnis habērent. Sed ego (ait) in rūpe mānsuētum vīdī 
gregem: quidnī possīs duōs trēsve haedōs cum pābulō vīvōs nāvī 
impōnere, quandō in eō erimus ut solvāmus?—Tum videō errāsse mē 
per properantiam: porrō mālus novus erat caedendus. Igitur 
respondeō: “Bene est: quidquid poterimus, faciēmus.” Tamen dē 
meīs haedīs aegrē ferēbam: nam quidquid mihi cicur factum est, 
et ē meā manū pāscēbātur, id jugulāre dolēbat mē. 391. Dē olōre 
oblītus eram facere mentiōnem: nunc sententiam mūtō. In Cortopem 
convertor, interprete Gelaviō. Multō cum honōre illum maximō 
ālite dōnō, item duābus mortuīs antilopis, ut suīs rēmigibus, sī 
sibi libeat, praebeat epulum. Addō, nōlle mē orȳzam ab ipsō 
ōrāre, nisi esset, unde supplērem. Is laetus accipit, 
pollicēturque lintrēs ad convehendum crās mittere.—Tum ā 
Totopillō quaerō, numve avēs porcillōsve cēperit. Nōndum ūllōs, 
respondet.—Igitur differās (ajō) hanc rem, dōnec resarciātur 
nāvis: nunc ex ūnō illō lepore cēnam apparā.—Id ille properat. 
392. Cōnfectā cēnā, Cortops ad suōs vult extemplō redīre. Ego 
cum magistrō trāns rūpem ambulō, ut arborēs mālō idōneās oculīs 
lūstret. Quattuor, quās dēnotat, crētā distinguō: hae erant in 
saltū meō. Dēscendēns ad flūmen quīntam animadvertī, ejusdem 
ferē magnitūdinis, quae pōpulī īnstar gerēbat. Hanc ut propiōrem 
commendō, atque ille comprobat. Tum ajō: “Fabrum tū nāvis tuae 
crās hūc mittitō: sī quid jūmentīs opus fuerit, ego per virōs 
meōs praebēbō.”—“Ēheu! (respondet): faber meus cum īnsignissimō 
illō improbōrum fuit ā barbarīs occīsus: idque mē male habet, 
quod nēmō apud mē est, quī arborem in mālum dēdolāre calleat. 
Sed nisi inter vōs quispiam est fabrīlī arte exercitus, nautae 
meī, ut ut poterunt, caedent.” Tum nārrō et mē et quōsdam ē meīs 
ex necessitāte multam reī fabrīlī dedisse operam; et posse nōs, 
sī velit, hanc rem aliquō tandem modō perficere. Id libēns 
audit: ait sē, mālō, quī frāctus sit, in rīpam expositō, 
alterum, ejusdem plānē mēnsūrae, imperātūrum mihi; pretiumque 
ejus, pecūniā aestimātum, in acceptī tabulam mihi relātūrum. Tum 
ego, quantum possum, spondeō: is ad suam scapham abit, in nāvem 
reditūrus; ego ad cavernās. 393. Posterō diē sine ūllā 
difficultāte Pachus et Calefus arborem illam succīdunt et rāmōs 
amputant. Nāvis cum mātūtīnō aestū ōstium subit flūminis, 
mālumque illum cōnfrāctum in rīpam excutit. Ibi ego 
accūrātissimē omnēs ejus partēs mētior cōnscrībōque. Fabrīlia 
nāvis īnstrūmenta recognōscō: mōlem quandam cochleātam mūtuor et 
maximās cōnfībulās plūrēs; quoniam utrōque in fīne inter 
operandum dēbeat arbor firmiter dēstinārī. Dolābrās item et 
runcīnās inde sūmō, nē, sī nostrae in caedendō retundantur, 
absūmātur tempus. Ego quidem vidēbar plūs festīnāre quam 
magister; ināniter crēdō: sed spem redeundī oblātam tandem, mōra 
ūnīuscujusque diēī vidēbātur imminuere. Videō crās operam 
perfectum īrī: igitur Totopillum jubeō, quam mātūrrimē possit, 
testūdinem capere; mox pābulum haedīnum in nāvem congerere. 
Enimvērō crās, id est, tertiō diē, ut spērāvī, mālum perfēcimus. 
Vespere Gelavium ad Cortopem mittō, nūntiātūrum, mē gravissimā 
dē rē velle colloquī, quae cum plēbe suā dēbeat commūnicārī; 
quārē in ejus honōrem, nisi quid nōlit, ipsum mē ad eum māne 
ventūrum. Respondet, libentī fore. 

394. Māne, rēgium vestītum gerēns, meā in scaphā, comitantibus 
Calefō, Pachō, Gelaviō, circumnāvigāvī ad Cortopem. Is mē multō 
cum honōre excipit. Tumulum quendam vel tribūnal ē caespite 
exstrūxerant, in quod mēcum ascendit, et in arundināceō quōdam 
pictō tapēte mē requiēscere jubet. Tum ad contiōnem suōrum verba 
facit,—crēdō ut mē iīs commendet: illī conclāmant plaudentēs. 
Assurgō et manibus gesticulor: nihil aliud poteram. Dein 
dēscendimus, et per Gelavium ōrō, ut Cortops mēcum et Calefō 
seorsum colloquātur. Jam mē aperiō, Calefō interprete. 395. Ajō, 
mē omnibus īnsulae meae cīvibus summam optāre prōsperitātem: 
hanc ut affirmem, praecipuae mihi esse cūrae. Illum, quippe 
virum nōbilem, mītem, seniōrem et diū nōtum, quāsdam propter 
causās mē ipsō fortasse melius eōrum fortūnīs praesessūrum: 
quārē ūnā sub condiciōne esse mihi in animō, ut dē prīncipātū 
illī cēdam.—Prīmō nōn crēdit Calefum rēctē interpretārī. Bis 
terque interrogābat, et, ut iterārētur rēs, postulāvit. Igitur 
ego, rēgiīs gemmīs dē meō collō dētractīs, illīus super capite 
sustinēbam. Sēnsī hominem valdē movērī. Tum quaesīvit, quaenam 
foret illa ūna condiciō? Respondeō:—Quoniam illī nōn essent 
fīliī, postulāre mē, ut Gelavium prō suō fīliō et prīncipātūs 
successōre adoptāret; et postquam ego cōram contiōne Cortopem 
meīs rēgālibus exōrnāssem, is rūrsus Gelavium, prō suō fīliō ac 
successōre prōnūntiātum, rēgiō aliquō mōre pūblicē agnōsceret. 
Libentissimē hanc condiciōnem accēpit. 396. Tunc adhibitīs in 
colloquium Pachō ac Gelaviō, retegō quid āctum sit. Pachus 
laetātur, Gelavius obstupēscēns lacrimātur, interrogatque, numne 
abeam. Prōtenus explicō; hanc nāvem meōrum esse populārium et ad 
meam redīre patriam: oportēre mē, patris senectūtem amanter 
fovēre; porrō hīc mē, sī maximē linguae Indicānae forem perītus, 
paucīs aliquot posse esse cārissimum, ūniversīs nōn posse esse 
acceptum grātumque prīncipem. Nōn mē paenitēre quod artem 
litterārum iīs per Gelavium trādiderim. Hanc sī excolant, fīliōs 
fore patribus, nepōtēs fīliīs usque sapientiōrēs. Sed opus meum 
hāc in īnsulā fīnītum esse.—Profundum subsequitur silentium. 
397. Post paulisper Cortopem rogō, numquid obstet, quōminus rem 
illicō perficiāmus. Ille, quasi ēvigilāns, vacuīs oculīs aliquid 
respondet. Interpretantur: “Nihil quod sciam.” Tum Calefus in 
caespitem ēscendēns pauca prōclāmat, populum in contiōnem 
revocāns. Opperīmur, dōnec quam plūrimī reveniant. Tum Cortopis 
manum tenēns, cum eō iterum ēscendō, cūnctīs mīrantibus quid 
agātur. Prōtenus ego meō capite dētractam cristam Cortopis 
impōnō capitī, et monīle meum ē bullīs fulgentissimīs et 
versicolōribus collō ejusdem circumpōnō. Adstrepit plēbs 
gestiēns. Mox Pachus explicat, mē in honōrem Cortopis dē meō 
prīncipātū cēdere. Conclāmātur ab ūniversīs. Dēscendimus ego ac 
Pachus: Gelavium ēscendere jubeō. 398. Rūrsus Cortops palam 
nūntiat, sē pūblicē Gelavium prō suō fīliō adoptāre, quem sē 
mortuō dēbeant prō prīncipe venerārī. Post haec dicta, ipsum 
illud monīle meum, suō collō dētractum, impōnit Gelaviō, quō 
manifēstior meīs sit oculīs ācta rēs. Applaudō. Tum Cortops 
Gelaviī collō manūs suās circumdat, et paternum eī ōsculum 
imprimit. Dein brevissimum aliquid prōclāmat, quod mox mihi 
explicant: “Ēn vōbīs fīlius meus!” Mox maximā cum acclāmātiōne 
discēditur. Ōrō Cortopem, ut propter mea summa negōtia, sī illī 
id nōn sit incommodum, ad meum portum secundō māne veniat. Mox 
multā cum caerimōniā dēcēdentēs, domum scaphā petīvimus. Haec 
quārtō erant diē, post nāvis adventum. Eōdem sānē diē novus ille 
mālus per duo jūmenta ad nāvem ā Totopillō dēductus est.



CAPUT (XIV.) QUĀRTUMDECIMUM.


399. Quīntō diē novus ille mālus suum in locum fīgitur. Ego 
autem quidquid volēbam asportāre, dēligēbam, compōnēbam,—
laetāns, maerēns, gemēns, mīrē varius, et valdē taciturnus. 
Statuī autem mē ante quīntum fīnītum diem meās rēs omnēs 
cōnfectūrum: atque cōnfēcī. 400. Sextō diē pervēnit Cortops, sīc 
ut rogāveram. Pulcherrimum eī gladiōrum meōrum, quī erat ē 
chalybe caeruleō, atque ūnam novāculam cum cōticulā suā 
coriaceā, dōnō dō; item optimam ignipultam aucupāriam: dīcōque, 
sī artem jaculandī velit discere, posse ā Gelaviō docērī. Mox 
furcillam mēnsālem et cochlear, quae argentea habēbam, ut rēgiī 
jūris, dētulī. Īnstrūmentum meum fabrīle ac coquīnārium omne eī 
exhibuī, jussīque, sī quid praesertim vellet, inde dēligere. 
Nihil ille nisi ferream crātem, sartāginem[Y] et duās secūrēs 
dēlēgit. Serrās dīxit sē cūnctās concupīscere; sed accipere,—id 
fore impudentis. Tum ego arrīdēns dīcō, quidquid cum Gelaviō 
relīquerim, ejus ūsum frūctumque penes Gelaviī patrem 
prīncipemque fore. Mox addidī, nescīre mē, quantī meam ille 
scapham aestimāret; Gelaviī et Totopillī operā fuisse exōrnātam; 
sed honōris causā, acciperet ā mē. Honōris (respondet) causā 
libentissimē sē accipere. Dēnique sēricam meam umbellam illī 
trādō, quoniam haec quoque rēgium quiddam habēre vidēbātur. Post 
prandium, ipsā in scaphā cum dōnīs meīs revertit, suam lintrem (
pulchram illam quidem) concēdēns Gelaviō, sagittāsque Totopillō 
cum arcū splendidiōre. Equidem meīs omnibus sēdulō multa 
grātificābar, maribus ignipultās pistolāsque imprīmīs, honōris 
fortasse causā, item aliās rēs plūrēs; sed fēminīs quae darī 
oporteat, aliquantō difficilius statuēbam. 

401. Rērum seriē abreptus, clādem cymbae omīsī nārrāre. Upis, 
praeter aliās operās, in piscibus colligendīs condiendīsque erat 
ūtilis. Solēbat in cymbā rētia mea ipsō in portū vīsere, inde 
piscēs reportāns. Haec mulier cum Larī item nova fēcit rētia, et 
vetera resarcīvit. Quōdam diē, quandō, rētī ēlātō, in eō erat ut 
piscēs extraheret, accipiter quīdam marīnus prō pisce certābat: 
id quod aliās ēvenīre nōveram; nam hominem hī ālitēs parum 
formīdābant. Ea surgēns, rēmō afflīxit ālitem; sed vī verberis 
oblīquē sē ē cymbā praecipitāvit. Forte plēnus tum maximē erat 
aestus, marī satis tumidō. Cymba, resorbente aestū, extrā 
asportātur, mox in scopulōs afflīgitur. Mulier ēnatāns facile 
terram attigit: cymbae nīl nisi tabulās quāsdam et ūnum rēmum 
recuperāvimus. 

402. Totopillus, ut prīmum tempestās favet, trēs testūdinēs ope 
Gelaviī ac Pachī reportat. Hās cum plūrimīs cibīs vīvās ad nāvem 
ego cum Gelaviō, ipsīus in lintre, convehō: ibi cum magistrō 
colloquor. Polliceor vīvōs haedōs pusillōs quattuor: 
dēmōnstrōque, sī amplius vellet pābulī, nautās posse ē valle 
metere. Antennās, ait ille, mālī etiam dēesse; rogatque anne 
possim frāctī mālī antennās probē affīgere, cēterāsque rēs 
concinnāre: suōs enim nautās valdē esse inhabilēs, quōs ē 
Corrhagīā dūxisset. Crēdō posse mē operam cōnficere; sed 
Dominicus diēs accēdēbat. Nē post discessum meum prōrsus 
negligerētur ille diēs, comperendināvī rem. “Diē Lūnārī (dīxī), 
sī poterō, perficiam; tum tū diē Mārtis nāvem fortasse solvēs.” 
Sē fore praestō, ait, sī ventus faveat. 

403. Tum seorsum magistrō dīcō; quoniam fabrum nōn habeat, 
quidnī mē prō fabrō suō rediēns accipiat? Rīdet prīmō 
incrēdulus; sed quandō mē sērium videt, respondet, “Sit sānē, ut 
vīs. Sī opera tua fabrīlis nāvī suffēcerit, plēnam fabrī 
mercēdem ā sociīs meīs domī accipiēs. Servātae nāvis praemium 
tibi erit integrum. Prō cibīs quōs praebēs, pecūniam nōn 
numerābō quidem nunc, sed aestimābō.” 404. Tum quālēs habeat 
mercēs, interrogō. Ait sē ad Jamaicam portāre agricolendī 
īnstrūmentum, item vīlia servōrum vestīmenta, et quidquid 
colōniae sit idōneum. Num serrās habeat, num pālās, rogō. 
Maximē, ait. Tum ego decem serrās, decem pālās, quadrāgintā 
cultellōs plicātilēs, quadrāgintā vestēs ē gossypiō, et longī 
gossypiī quattuor fascēs, emō; novum dōnum Cortopī. Sīc propter 
orȳzam spērō ejus plēbī satis repēnsum īrī. Mox varia cōnficiō 
fēminīs nostrīs mūnuscula, aliqua virīs meīs, quae referre 
taedet: longē plūra sānē Gelaviō cōnferō, inter quae duo pōnō 
dōlia pulveris nitrātī, quattuor missilis plumbī sacculōs. Hās 
rēs omnēs magister contrā mē in tabulam impēnsī refert, 
pollicēturque in cavernās meās dēportāre. 405. Crās, quī diēs 
erat Dominī, plūrimī convēnēre, ut mē ultimum salūtārent. Multa 
dīxī benignē, sed moribundī hominis animum gerēbam. Multīs 
Gelavium monuī, ut quantum posset, nōn hīs tantum virīs, sed 
posterīs prōspiceret; nempe, sī seniōrum cōnsiliō dē agrīs 
colendīs, dē ūsūfrūctū agrōrum ac maris, dē aedibus condendīs, 
dē māteriē saxī caementīque fruendā, lēgēs aequās firmāsque 
prōmulgāret. Dē tālibus rēbus prout lēgēs bonae exercentur, ita (
dīxī) cīvitātis cujusque viget polletque status. Sī dē hīs quae 
Deus dōnāvit mortālibus aequē jūstēque inter hominēs statūtum 
sit, tum fore ut singulōrum industria vigeat, ūniversōrum cōpiae 
abundent; neque umquam ūberrimā in īnsulā dēfore prīncipī 
tūtāmenta majestātis, sī usque ad humillimum quemque cīvem 
dēscenderit prīncipis aequitās.—Ille mea verba quasi haurit 
atque recondit, rārō respondēns aut paucissima. Tandem ait (
ignōscat mihi lēctor, quod referō,) “Ō ere, numquam ego voluī 
rēgnāre; sed sī anteā nescīrem, in tē didicī quaenam essent 
rēgnātōris elementa.” 406. Posteā dīxī: “Nae tū, quidquid 
ēvēnerit, id agās, ut numquam hāc in īnsulā duo sint inter sē 
līberī prīncipēs. Sī ad tempus id dēvītārī nequībit, at tū per 
foedus facitō ut fīliī vestrī ac fīliī omnium quī in eādem hāc 
erunt īnsulā, eōdem summō prīncipe ūtantur. Quam mītēs sītis 
inter vōs, tū optimē nōveris. Quam atrōx fūnestumque possit esse 
bellum, ego videō, quattuor illōs fortēsque requīrēns Cortopis 
fīliōs. Tū in frātris jam locō es ergā Totopillum; cūr, quaesō, 
ācerrimī quondam crūdēlissimīque fuistis hostēs?” Lacrimā 
obortā, “Tū conciliāstī,” inquit. Dē sē nihil prōmittēbat. 

407. Diē Lūnārī antennās resarcīvimus: tum fūnēs nautae ipsī 
ōrdinābant. Magister queritur, inter frūctūs nōn fuisse līmōnās, 
dē quā rē illicō imperābam. Mox Totopillus octo avēs vīvās 
dētulit, quīnque mortuās; ex hīs trēs grandēs erant; ōtidēs esse 
crēdidī. Dīxit habēre sē porcillōs quoque, crās fortasse alia 
dēlātūrum. 408. Ego ūnam acum polārem, ūnum pār pistolārum, 
bitubam meam, alteramque aucupāriam mēcum eram āvectūrus; item 
quidquid proprium fuit Brazīlicī magistrī. Quidquid nēminī datum 
relinquerem, id omne prōnūntiō Gelaviī esse. Hunc porrō rogāvī, 
ut in mātris meae honōrem cocum illam in portū rigāret 
fovēretque. 

409. Summō māne experrēctī, maximā cum exspectātiōne multī 
mortālēs discurrimus. Totopillus mātūrē porcillōs vīvōs trēs 
dētulit, novamque avium cōpiam, inter quās columbī erant ē meīs 
vīvī. Sērius Fenis, Laris, Pachus fiscellam līmōnum suō quisque 
in capite dēportat. Mox ā Cortope nūntius rēmigum operam 
pollicētur, sīquā forte opus sit. Sed propter ventum 
adversissimum et cautēs vadōsī maris parum nōtās, magister 
honōrificō respōnsō negat sē audēre hodiē ēgredī: id quod multum 
doleō. 410. Nam suspēnsīs intentīsque animīs maestissimum est 
sēgnitia: item, parātīs rēbus omnibus, quid nōbīs nisi sēgnitia 
restat? Proptereā, prōcēdente diē, juvābat mē quod magister, 
plūrima interrogandō, multum ā mē sermōnem ēlicuit. Praecipuē 
mīrābātur, quō tandem fātō ego, Anglus homō, inter Lūsitānōs 
Brazīliēnsēs ineunte adolēscentiā fuerim colōnus, ubi ipsa 
religiō dēterret Anglōs. Ubi Gelavius quoque ōrāvit, ut tōtam 
hanc rem plēnius explicārem, in plēnā nautārum contiōne hanc 
tandem in modum locūtus sum. 411. Ego, in nāve Anglicā ad 
Guineam nāvigāns, ā Maurō pīrātā captus sum cum sociīs nostrīs 
nāvālibus. Is mē quattuor ferē annōs prō servulō labōrāre 
coēgit. Tandem fēlīcī audāciā aufūgī, in phasēlō erī 
vēlōcissimō, ūnum puerum Maurum simul asportāns. Ipsō in Ōceanō 
nāve Lūsitānā exceptī sumus atque ad Brazīliam dēvectī. Magister 
negat sē prō naulō quidquam ā fugitīvō Chrīstiānō acceptūrum: 
prō phasēlō et rēbus omnibus quās asportāvī, ipse pollicētur 
pretium. Dēnique ab hōc virō līberālī, postquam in Omnium 
Sānctōrum Sinū ancoram jacimus, persolūta mihi est summa 
ducentārum vīgintī minārum Lūsitānārum. Hoc caput mihi erat 
pecūniae, in Brazīliam expositō. Fatendum autem est mē clam 
patre nāvigāsse; nōluisse mē idcircō sīc revertī in patriam, ut 
parentis opēs iners cōnsūmerem. 412. Illa sānē regiō, immēnsa 
agrōrum, profunda saltibus, vacua virōrum, advenās libentissimē 
excipit: nec diū exspectō, antequam apud colōnum quendam in 
agricultūram adhibear. Prīmō quidem propter linguam ignōtam 
parum eram ūtilis. Poteram sānē colentibus astāre, observāre, 
sēgnitiam cohibēre, et modicā quādam operā cibum tēctumque 
merērī, ut nē ex meō impendērem. Interim per eundem nāvis 
magistrum trānsigēbam, ut ex Angliā pecūniae quaedam meae ad mē 
mitterentur. Is nempe, Olisīpōnem reditūrus, crēdēbat sē illīc 
posse id prōcūrāre, sī ego litterās sibi ad meārum pecūniārum 
sequestrem cōnfīderem; id quod libenter fēcī. (At fēmina habēbat 
nummōs meōs, vidua magistrī nāvis, prīmī meī atque optimī 
patrōnī.) Posteā autem vir benignus, rē meā tamquam suā ipsīus 
accūrātius perpēnsā, ait nummīs nēquāquam opus esse; sed caput 
pecūniae, postquam dē summā certior venīret ab Angliā nūntius, 
Lūsitānā merce mūtandum, quālis praesertim Brazīliae esset 
idōnea. Posse mē post aliquod tempus Olisīpōnem ad sē scrībere, 
sīquid potissimum vellem: sīn minus, tum quaecumque sibi 
vidērentur, reportātūrum. Grātiās sānē ēgī, litterāsque ad 
amīcam viduam composuī, in quibus omnia, quae contigerant, 
strictim nārrābantur. Ea, postquam redditae sunt hae litterae, 
laeta effugiō meō, propter marītī suī memoriam Lūsitānum 
magistrum ex suō līberāliter dōnat, simul parentibus meīs cūncta 
impertit. Comperīre nōn potuī, crēdō tamen, meās apud illam 
pecūniās ā patre cōnfestim auctās esse; nam merx quam dēmum 
accēpī, aliquantō plūs erat quam quod aut exspectāveram aut 
potuī explicāre. Sed redeō unde dēflexī. 413. Colōnus ille (
Araūjō eī erat nōmen) cujus in operis eram, agrī dītior erat 
quam pecūniae, nec potuit nātūrālī agrōrum ūbertāte ita fruī ut 
dēbēbat. Ager per servōs colitur. Atquī ille neque tot servōs, 
quot opus erant, habēbat, neque īnstrūmentum satis amplum, sī, 
propāgātā cultūrā, reditūs ac commercia opperīrētur. Ut 
industrium mē prīmō esse vīdit, agrīque colendī haud ignārum; 
mox, intellēxit nummōrum mē aliquantum manū tenēre, aliās 
exspectāre ab Angliā pecūniās: sēnsī eum familiārius mē 
compellāre, tum saepius astāre, velle colloquī, ad mēnsam 
interdum adhibēre. Mox puerīs uxōrīque mē commendat. Garriō cum 
puerīs, rūrī comes fīō; lūdum quasi gladiātōrium faciō,—nōn cum 
ipsō gladiō, nam virga prō tēlō erat,—dum doceō quōmodo Anglus 
nauta, quōmodo Maurus, feriat, arceat. Quae omnia nōn modo 
animum meum inter peregrīnōs valdē sōlābantur, sed propter 
linguae quoque ūsum prōderant. Lusitānicē loquī ex puerīs discō, 
cum patre sermōnēs ⸤ipsīus dē rē⸥ habeō artiōrēs. 414. Tandem is 
sē aperit. Benignē dē mē quaedam praefātus, ait,—Sī socium haud 
pauperem habēret, ambōbus lautius fore quam nunc sibi sōlī: 
tantam esse agrī ūbertātem, caelī tepōrem, aquārum abundantiam. 
Mē, sī in haereticā religiōne persistam, agrōs meō nōmine nōn 
posse in Brazīliā tenēre. Sānē sē velle, concordēs forent omnēs 
Chrīstiānī: sīn autem id fierī nōn possit, tum—idōneā factā 
syngraphā, quīn pecūniās in fundō ejus collocem, amplōsque 
reditūs fēnore accipiam? 

415. Ubi cibus abundat et jūcunda āeris temperiēs facilī operā 
corpus fovet, ibi (opīnor) animī ad līberālitātem, apud nōs ad 
avāritiam, sunt prōpēnsiōrēs. Itaque colōnī illī sunt haud rārō 
sēgnēs, negligentēs, prōdigī; profectō nōn sunt illīberālēs. 
Quārē, quae in medium prōferēbat, cōmiter excutiēbam; neque 
abhorrēbam ā virō, vultū mōribusque jūxtā benignō. 416. Illud 
quoque cōnsīderābam; Lūsitāniam Angliae artiōre quōdam vinculō 
astringī, ex quō tempore formīdanda illa, ingēns potentiae 
Hispānia, nostra dīrissima atque implācābilis hostis, ē 
possessiōne Lūsitāniae est exturbāta: quō tūtiōrēs mihi fore 
pecūniās, apud cīvem Lūsitānum collocātās. 417. Dēnique 
cōnsēnsī; scrīptīsque litterīs, quās mercēs ille dēsīderābat 
potissimum, hās ego Olisīpōne reportandās ad mē rogāvī. Pecūniās 
propter praesentēs ūsūs illicō poteram ex arcā meā cōnferre. 
Pacīscitur porrō, ut ego operās agrestēs cūrem regamque, ille 
praestet mihi ex ipsō fundō cibum, servōs, equōs, cūncta quae 
maximī sunt: cētera ex praesentī pecūniā atque ex annuō fēnore 
facile solvō. 418. Mīranda sānē est illā in regiōne arborum 
atque fruticum tum cōpia, tum prōcēritās. Plūrimārum nōmina 
arduum est dīcere: immō, prōrsus populīs Eurōpaeīs sunt 
incognita. Celebris est ibi mandioca ēsculenta, item milium 
atque zēa Indica, item banāna, et orȳza satīva. Atquī ego, quī 
plūrima terrā nāscentiā apud Maurōs didiceram, tamen longē plūra 
hīc prīmō ignōta invēnī. 419. Noster quidem fundus saccharum 
praecipuē et tabācum gignēbat. Rādīcēs ēsculentās, olera, 
cereālia, ipsī in suīs agellīs servī ēducant, erōque praestant 
ūnus quisque aliquantum. Ille sēmina quaedam, īnstrūmenta, 
vestīmenta, tēcta domōrum cōnfert; cūncta administrat, dēfendit, 
rēgia vectīgālia persolvit. 420. Per biennium plūrima circā 
fundum erant novanda. Plūs aliquandō excolēbantur agrī. Saepēs, 
viae, portulae erant cōnficiendae: tum casulae novae, pluteī. 
Distribuendum īnstrūmentum, cultūra regenda, multa novē docenda. 
Irrigātiōne nōn opus erat; dumtaxat propter orȳzam quibusdam in 
agellīs cohibēbantur rīvulī dēcurrentēs. Tertiō itidem annō 
multā opus erat alacritāte et perpēnsātiōne dīligentissimā, ut 
ad amussim jūdicārem quid sapienter, quid stultē impēnsum; quae 
retinendae ratiōnēs, quae mūtandae forent. Necnōn, ipsōrum 
servōrum ingeniīs jam melius perspectīs, ad suās quemque cūrās 
frūctuōsius poteram dispōnere. Tantummodo nōn satis habēbāmus 
virōrum in operīs, quamquam vernulae quotannīs nāscēbantur, et 
post aliquot annōs vidēbantur suffectūrī. 421. Attamen quārtō 
jam annō affluēbant opēs, servulī continuam officiōrum rotam 
persequēbantur. Socius (sīve collēga) ille meus Araūjō, vetus 
negōtiandī, externās fundī nostrī rēs dīligenter administrābat. 
Ego vērō quasi bracchiīs replicātīs poteram dītēscere, nisi quod 
propter novam hanc sēgnitiam tum maximē fundī, regiōnis, 
hominum, meīque ipsīus taedēbat mē. 

422. Dēbēbam fortasse uxōrem dūcere, sed religiō locī 
impediēbat: nōn quod ego Anglicī cultūs tenāx fuerim atque 
ostentātor; nam extrā, vix dīversus ā cēterīs vidēbar. Sciēbam 
autem, ut prīmum mātrimōnium contemplārer, extemplō sacerdōtēs 
dē meā religiōne fore cūriōsissimōs; dein artās connūbiī lēgēs 
postulātūrōs, quibus neque uxor sit mea ipsīus, neque līberī 
neque domus neque servī; sed sacerdōs suā sponte intret, 
cognōscat, ōrdinet, imperitet; cūnctōs, sī libitum fuerit, 
contrā mē cohortētur. Id vērō nōn erat ferendum. Itaque sōlus 
manēbam, sōlum mē fovēbam, oblectābam: mox, mē ipsum perōsus, 
inquiētō agitābar animō. 

423. Ita affectō subita supervenit vītae conversiō, quam satis 
mīrārī nōn possum. Collēga ille sīve magister meus sēdulō mē ad 
sē vocat; ait, gravī dē rē velle sē colloquī; aurēs benignās et 
patientēs sē ōrāre. Ego, mīrābundus quid sit, respondeō, esse 
mihi ōtiī satis superque, et perlibenter mē auscultātūrum. 424. 
Tum īnfit: Opulentiōrem sē per mē in diēs fierī. Quidquid dīcat, 
nē sē putem ingrātum, nēve velle ab sē mē āmōtum. Multa mē fundō 
suō optimē fēcisse, ūnum nōn potuisse facere, ut plūrēs essent 
servulī. Id sī fieret, multō etiam perfectius lātiusque excolī 
posse agrōs. Operam meam per triennium ūtilem fuisse, immō 
necessāriam; jam ipsam per sē quasi cōnfectam: sīc enim mē rēs 
administrāsse, ut nōn jam indigērent meī. Nunc sī sibi suīsque 
familiāribus cōnsultum velim, in eō rēs esse ut valdē possim 
adjuvāre. 425. Hic pausam fēcit: ego autem exspectāns etiam 
tacuī. Tum dē novō incipit: Audīsse sē ex mē, nāvigāsse mē ad 
Guineam commerciī caussā. Sī iterum vellem eōdem proficīscī, 
sibi amīcīsque grātum fore, mihi ipsī fortasse nōn malum. Etenim 
plūrēs notāsse, mē, quī anteā hilaris strēnuusque fuissem, nūper 
taciturnum ēvāsisse, maestum, languidum. Fortasse propter 
valētūdinem mūtandum āera. Excursiōnem maritimam corporī 
mentīque fore salūbrem. 426. Interrogantī mihi, Quid autem ego 
tibi tuīsque circā Guineam sum prōfutūrus? respondet: Imprīmīs 
tū ratiōnem hujus commerciī atque idōneās mercēs intellegis, 
quās hinc oporteat exportāre: tum, (quod est māxumum) servōs 
nigrītās, quōs volumus coemere, tū clēmenter regēs, sānōs 
dēportābis. Līberē tēcum dē tē loquar. Difficile est virum bonā 
familiā, hūmānē īnstitūtum, benevolum, veterem reī maritimae, 
strēnuum negotiandō, regendī capācem reperīre, quī servitia 
vēnālia conquīrat. Atquī vel maximē tālī virō hīc est opus. 427. 
Tū hominēs barbarōs benignē excipiēs, dēmulcēbis, ad obsequium 
dūcēs lēniter: aliī efferōs, contumācēs, trīstēs, vel languidōs, 
morbōsōs, sēmimortuōs important. Nōs tē volumus sine tuō 
impendiō īre. Manicipiā dē nostrō coemēs: dēportāta inter nōs 
dīvidēmus; tū parem nōbīs habēbis sortem. Porrō, quod nunc tibi 
propter operam tuam agrestem attribuō, id omne, pecūniā 
aestimātum, quamdiū in nāve sīs, solvam. 428. Nesciō an laus meī 
mē nōnnihil oblectāverit: cēterum respondeō, admīrāns sī per 
rēgium praefectum tālis expedītiō licēret: nam rēx jūs 
servitiōrum vēnditandōrum paucīs quibusdam propter magnam 
pecūniam concēdit. At ille: “Nihil nōs contrā rēgis ēdicta sumus 
factūrī. Palam nōn licet vēnditāre, at nōs prōrsus nōn vēndēmus. 
Et vērō, quō certius rēs sē habeat, mūneribus quibusdam 
sagāciter distribūtīs efficiāmus ut nē nimia dē nāvis onere sit 
investīgātiō. 429. Accēdit quod sacerdōtēs tāle inceptum 
vehementer comprobant. Barbarōs hominēs, quōrum vīta (lībera 
sit, an servīlis) saeva est, impia, foeda,—hōs in mānsuētum 
servitium sub benignitāte Chrīstiānā trādere, vērae ajunt esse 
pietātis. Jam nāvis parāta est; merx, quālem tū jubēbis, cito 
parābitur.” 

430. Neque valdē placēbat mihi neque displicēbat haec expedītiō. 
Haud amplius juvenālī ārdōre in maria irruēbam, et tamen amābam 
mare atque ipsam operum commūtātiōnem. Condiciōnēs vīdī aequās 
esse, rem lucrōsam, neque amīcōs hominēs rejicere facile fuit. 
Rē ponderātā, dēmum cōnsēnsī. Tum quasi intermortuus, sōlemnī 
testāmentō omnia conclūdō. Benignum illum nāvis magistrum, quī 
mē ex marī servāverat, hēredem īnstituō ex sēmisse. Alterum 
sēmissem reī meae ad Angliam remittendum dēstinō, cōnscrībōque 
singillātim, quid opus factō sit. Sānē, sī, ut in testāmentō fuī 
prōvidus, sīc in vītā dīrigendā fuissem sagāx, numquam tantās 
aerumnās exsul ab hominis genere forem perpessus. 

431. Jamque parātīs rēbus omnibus, solvimus ā portū ipsīs Nōnīs, 
Augustō mēnse. Prīmō ad septemtriōnēs nāvigāvimus, paene lītus 
Americae nostrae legentēs, tempestāte bonā, dumtaxat vehementer 
calidā, dōnec ad prōmontorium Augustīniānum dēvēnimus. Inde ad 
Aquilōnēs versus, tamquam ad īnsulam Ferdinandī Nerōniānī 
dīrēximus cursum, citoque terram condidimus. Duodecimō diē turbō 
ventōrum ex Austrō conversus dētorquētur in Eurum, inde in 
Aquilōnem, violentiā semper augēscēns. 432. Nōs, multum contrā 
luctātī, necessāriō tempestāte dēferimur. Ē sodāliciō ūnus vir 
febre victus dēcessit: mox nauta ac puer, superscandente flūctū, 
asportantur. Ut potuit magister, paulum dēcrēscente ventō, 
caelum observāre, crēdidit nōs prope Septentriōnāle continentis 
lītus, circā Orinocōnis ōstia, dēvectōs. Nāvem negat Atlanticum 
mare trājiciendī jam esse compotem: igitur mē in cōnsilium 
adhibitō, rēctā domum redeundum cēnset. Id vērō vehementer nōlō; 
īnspectōque marī in chartīs dēscrīptō, suādeō ut Barbādam petat, 
vītātō aestūs dēcursū, quī sinum Mēxicānum invehitur. 433. Ille 
cōnsēnsit nē redeat, clāvumque ita flectit, ut quī in aliquō 
Anglārum Antillium portū cupiat nāvem reficere. Hāc spē 
adductus, iterum nōs in altum committit: attamen novae procellae 
īnfortūnātam nāvem excipiunt. Dēnique, nē longus sim, multum 
reluctātī, in hās ipsās arēnās dēpellimur, ubi vestra nāvis 
afflīcta est. Sed nōs, scaphā cōnantēs effugere, salō maris 
obrutī sumus, unde ego sōlus ēvāsī vīvus. Cēterum nāvis ad 
plēnilūnium dūrāvit incolumis, et praebuit mihi, nōn vīctum 
modo, sed paene īnsulae hujus imperium. 

434. Tālia ubi dīxeram, multa inter sē colloquuntur, atque alia 
interrogant, quibus Gelavium respondēre jubeō: sīc variō sermōne 
fīnītus est diēs. Nocte mūtātur ventus. Prīmā lūce magister mihi 
aperit, rēmigēs nunc posse multum adjuvāre; dē quō prōtinus 
nūntium mīsī. Hōrā ante merīdiem decem cum ipsō Cortope vēnēre. 
Meī quoque omnēs congregābantur, inter quōs (ignōscat lēctor!) 
canem paene lacrimāns aspiciō. Hunc, illīs tam ūtilem, asportāre 
nōluī: illud dolēbam, quod fēminam canem nōn potuī simul dare, 
nē ipsum genus perīret. 435. Mox solvunt ancoram. Movētur nāvis 
cum aestū, remulcī applicantur, flūmen dēscendimus. Vōcibus, 
vultū, gestū, plēnīs cāritāte, plēnīs item magnō maerōre, 
discēdimus. Ad caelum surgit cor meum, quaeritantis ecquandō 
eccubi hōsce tam fidēlēs, tam bonōs iterum conveniam. Gelavium 
oculī meī anquīrunt frūstrā: fortasse propter dolōrem sē 
occultābat. Ā terrā jam recēdēns, ēgregiam īnsulae 
pulchritūdinem admīror. Numquam sānē algae, fruticēta, 
praegrandēs arborēs, palmēta, collēs, aqua purpurea, caelum 
clārissimum, tam digna mihi anteā vīsa sunt Paradīsō. Sīc 
rēmigēs nōs trahunt, quamdiū magistrō id tūtius vidērētur. 436. 
Ut prīmum in altō sumus et rīte concinnantur vēla, magister mihi 
significat ut dīmittam lintrēs. Tum videō Gelavium, locō 
Cortopis, iīs esse praefectum. Is properē nāvem scandit, genua 
mea complectitur; et anteā quam verba possim illō mōmentō digna 
fingere, recesserat, ēvāserat. Extemplō inter lintrēs ac nāvem 
magnum exstitit intervāllum. Dēscendō in cellam meam, animum 
variīs mōtibus distractum, pietāte, sī possim recollēctūrus. 

437. Ad Caurum, quantum sineret ventus, semper contendēbāmus. 
Postquam quadrāgintā ferē mīllia cursūs fēcimus, nāvis Eurōpaea 
appāret; mercātōria nāvis, ut crēdimus. Eam versus rēctā 
tendēns, magister cannōnēs opem precantēs personārī jubet. Mox 
per prōspeculā vēxillum vidēmus Anglicum. “Forsitan (inquit 
magister) illā citius in nāve quam in meā patriam attingās.” Id 
mē dubitātiōne conturbat. Posteā ajō, sī maximē illa nāvis rēctā 
ad Angliam properet, praestat praemonēre parentēs, vīvere mē ac 
venīre. Dein meminī, quoniam prō fabrō operam locāssem meam, 
aequius esse, ut nē, nisi coāctus, pactum abrumperem; et 
quidquid reī pecūniāriae inter mē et magistrum pendēret, id 
benignius ā sociīs ejus aestimātum īrī, sī tunc nāvī adhaerērem. 
438. Igitur properē litterās cōnscrībō, quae ad patrem meum 
trāderentur, sī forte nāvis illa perferret. Quandō convenīmus, 
magister noster quaerit ab iīs, quānam in longitūdine terrestrī 
versēmur. Illī cōnfestim et longitūdinem et lātitūdinem nōbīs 
prōnūntiant; ajunt porrō Angliam sē dīrēctā petere. Magister 
meās aliāsque ā sē litterās iīs trādit; mox inter utrōsque 
discēditur. 439. Jamaicam sine noxā attigimus: hīc fīnis mihi 
erat vagandī. Dīvēnditā merce atque aliā merce assūmptā, iterum 
solvimus, et minus quīnquāgintā diēbus in Bristoliae portū 
recondimur. Inde epistolam ad patrem scrībō, et tenerrimō 
respōnsō exhilaror. 440. Trānsāctīs festīnanter negotiīs, aliās 
litterās ad Brazīliam compōnō. Quidquid dē meā rē ex meō 
testāmentō fēcisset optimus et amīcissimus meus hērēs, crēdēns 
mē mortuum, id omne cōnfirmō. Quidquid ex rē nāvis magistrī 
illīus, quī in naufragiō periit, apud mē teneō,—hōrologia, aurum 
Hispānum, aliaque,—haec et sī cujus alīus reī pretium excēperim, 
spondeō reparāre. Omnēs ibi amīcōs salvēre jubeō. 441. Tum 
properō ad parentēs, portāns mēcum documenta illa fidēlium 
ministrōrum, rēgiam tegetem dorsuālem, praecīnctōrium, 
calceāmenta, item clāvam bellicam virī occīsī. Nec diū est, quum 
Eborācī ad cārissimōrum ac diū neglēctōrum pertingō sinum, 
senectūtī patris mātrisque tenerā pietāte opitulātūrus.

EDITION NOTES


This version of Rebilius Crūsō differs in a number of points 
from the version originally published and edited on the Project 
Gutenberg in its primary form. The work was published with the 
main goal of an easier learning of Latin, and in particular of 
vocabulary, at a time when the oral distinction of the length of 
vowels was not a major concern (neither were the phonemes 
themselves), because the language was mostly written. This means 
that the work was published indicating the vowel length only to 
distinguish ambiguous forms (even sometimes with anomalies), the 
reader having to rely on already knowing the word (which defeats 
the purpose of the book), look up a dictionary for every new 
word, or learn the word without worrying about vowel length. 
Nowadays, the teaching of Latin tends to focus more on 
pronunciation and vowel length, so that such older works lose 
much of their interest, and even display aberrant forms that 
shouldn’t be considered as a reference. The solution is to 
provide a revised version that allows an easy access to vowel 
length, while adding some other fixes, such as follows:

First the correction of a number of printing errors 

Next, the systematic distinction of long vowels from short ones 
using macrons. Ambiguous forms were left as short. As for 
neologisms, some research was done in order to get the best 
approximation. Some guesswork was done on coined proper names, 
with sobriety. And some rare words of which the origin is 
unknown, were mostly left untouched. 

Finally, the way in which the words are written is 
characteristic of New Latin, initially aiming to restore the 
purity of the language compared to Medieval Latin, but itself 
suffering from a spelling influenced by folk etymology or bad 
litterary sources, thus disfiguring a certain number of words. 
Wherever such alterations have been spotted, they have been 
replaced in favor of the original most common spelling. Among 
all these changes, only a few have an effect on the grammar, or 
the very nature of the word.

Please also note that the original 
version noted adverbs with a grave accent on the last vowel of 
the word, as well as some other small aids for reading. This is 
a typical habit of New Latin, and isn't in use anymore in more 
modern books, especially when macrons are used, so they were not 
kept in this version. 

Fixed printing errors: (this list may be useful even for the
original version)

Examples of spelling changes.

* confusion between œ, æ and ē (folk etymology and broken
  pronunciation)
* seorsim > seorsum (folk etymology/corruption)
* -mt- > -mpt- (excessive purism leading to unconventional
  forms)
* -nq- > -mq- [when it applies] (mostly New Latin spelling)
* indies > in dies (non-standard contraction)
* intelligo > intellego (less-standard spelling)
* delĕgo > deligo (non-standard form that creates confusion)
* -mist- > -mixt- (rarer form)
* fasciculum > fasciculus (bad grammatical genre)
* cratibula > craticula (corruption)
* consĭdeo > consīdo (as “sit down”, “settle”, the form
  consĭdeo isn't standard)
* assis -is f (acc -im abl -i) > axis -is m (very uncommon
  variant absent from most dictionaries)
* arctus > artus (folk etymology)
* nuncius > nuntius (corruption due to bad pronunciation)
* some changes from i to j
* and also double consonants changed to simple ones, and
  reciprocally
